Go+ Security APIIntroduction
Welcome to Go+ Security API document.
Go+ Security Engine is the leading blockchain security server and platform. As a mean to provide easy
access to security data, we've developed the Go+ Security API.
The token security API is currently available.
Please use what you need.Source attribution via a backlink or a mention that your app is "Powered by GO+ Security" is
required except for personal/private usage.GoPlus Security API
Provide you with fast, reliable and convenient security services
GOPlus Security API has four key points：1.Token Security
Have Covered EVM chains, detecting 364k+ tokens and finding 183k+ risky tokens.The main components：
Contract Security, Trading Security, Info Security.
2.Real-Time Risk Warning
Real-time monitoring of on-chain data, first warning.The main components：AdminKeyChange, FlashLoan,
Price Slippage.
3.dApp Contract Security
Cover hundreds of major dAPPs and identify dApp contract risks.The main components：Contracts Own
Vulnerability, FlashLoan Risk, Compatibility Issue, Project Side Security.
4.Interaction Security
20K+ phishing sites included.The main components：Phishing Site, Approval Contract, NFT Authenticity,
Black Address Library.The token security API is currently available. Stay tuned for more content.ReferenceQuick StartGood to know: A quick start guide can be good to help folks get up and running with your API in

API v2)
Differences between Version1 and Version2
Different Usage
Version1 mainly supports inputting approved contracts and detects the security of approved contracts.
Version2 mainly supports inputting a EOA, viewing the contracts approved by the address and the
information of the approved contracts (basic information + risk detection) .
Different Application Scenarios
Version1 is more for the exchange, blockscan such as instant approval scenario. Version2 is more for the
wallet, users can view the approval history and check the security of approved contracts.Token Approval Security
