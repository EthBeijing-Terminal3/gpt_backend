U.S. The IRS issued guidance on the treatment of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in their March 2014-21 Notice [3]. The notice clarified the position that the IRS treats digital currencies as capital assets and are therefore subject to capital gains taxes. Any disposition of these digital currencies, including trading and spending, is a tax event and capital gains must be calculated in USD. When spending, the fair value should be used as the proceeds value. The IRS also clarified that mining is treated as immediate income at the fair or market value of those mined coins on their date of receipt. While the IRS Notice does confirm that Bitcoin is taxed as property rather than a currency, there are still some unresolved issues. For instance, how should a mined alt-coin income value be determined is there is no direct fiat market, and do alt-coins benefit from Like-Kind Exchanges [4]. There is a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) filing requirement for financial accounts in a foreign country when the aggregate value of the accounts exceeded $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. While the value of Bitcoins themselves don't count towards the FBAR threshold[5], there is the possibility that requirement applies to cash held in non-US bitcoin exchanges or wallet services[6]. An additional topic that may have a connection to Bitcoin is the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) filing requirement in the U.S.[7].

Essentially it is somewhat uncharted territory. Literally bitcoins, and even digital currencies are so new, that there is little to no precedent for some aspects of bitcoin mining, from a tax perspective. Since Bitcoins are currently traded in various online marketplaces, when someone receives a Bitcoin, they can reasonably calculate it’s value in the local currency. Because of this, it is possible that the taxing authority will treat the receipt of a Bitcoin through a mining pool, or from an individual mining operation, as a taxable event. At that time, the taxpayer would be required to estimate the value of the Bitcoins in dollars and record that amount. This would have to be done either daily or weekly depending on the value of the Bitcoins if their value keeps fluctuating as much as it has the past few weeks. These amounts would be recorded as revenue from bitcoin mining operations and would be taxable less allowed expenses. When selling mined Bitcoins, however, you would also be taxed on the increase between the value you recorded them at when you first received them, and the value you sold them for. Another possibility is that the government will consider mined Bitcoins ‘intangible personal property’. As a rule, however, financial instruments are excluded from this particular category. The question is, are bitcoins a financial instrument, or rather, will the taxing authority consider them a financial instrument? We will have to wait and see if bitcoins become popular enough for a position to be taken on that.'],\n",

              "   'Most people think of crypto mining simply as a way of creating new coins. Crypto mining, however, also involves validating cryptocurrency transactions on a blockchain network and adding them to a distributed ledger.  Most importantly, crypto mining prevents the double-spending of digital currency on a distributed network. Like physical currencies, when one member spends cryptocurrency, the digital ledger must be updated by debiting one account and crediting the other. However, the challenge of a digital currency is that digital platforms are easily manipulated. Bitcoin’s distributed ledger, therefore, only allows verified miners to update transactions on the digital ledger. This gives miners the extra responsibility of securing the network from double-spending. Meanwhile, new coins are generated to reward miners for their work in securing the network. Since distributed ledgers lack a centralized authority, the mining process is crucial for validating transactions. Miners are, therefore, incentivized to secure the network by participating in the transaction validation process that increases their chances of winning newly minted coins. In order to ensure that only verified crypto miners can mine and validate transactions, a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol has been put into place. PoW also secures the network from any external attacks.'],\n",

While miners of precious metals will unearth gold, silver, or diamonds, crypto miners will trigger the release of new coins into circulation. For miners to be rewarded with new coins, they need to deploy machines that solve complex mathematical equations in the form of cryptographic hashes. A hash is a truncated digital signature of a chunk of data. Hashes are generated to secure data transferred on a public network. Miners compete with their peers to zero in on a hash value generated by a crypto coin transaction, and the first miner to crack the code gets to add the block to the ledger and receive the reward. Each block uses a hash function to refer to the previous block, forming an unbroken chain of blocks that leads back to the first block. For this reason, peers on the network can easily verify whether certain blocks are valid and whether the miners who validated each block properly solved the hash to receive the reward. Over time, as miners deploy more advanced machines to solve PoW, the difficulty of equations on the network increases. At the same time, competition among miners rises, increasing the scarcity of cryptocurrency as a result.'],\n",

GPU mining is another method of mining cryptocurrencies. It maximizes computational power by bringing together a set of GPUs under one mining rig. For GPU mining, a motherboard and cooling system is required for the rig. Similarly, ASIC mining is yet another method of mining cryptocurrencies. Unlike GPU miners, ASIC miners are specifically designed to mine cryptocurrencies, so they produce more cryptocurrency units than GPUs.

It is also the way the network confirms new transactions and is a critical component of the blockchain ledger\\'s maintenance and development. \"Mining\" is performed using sophisticated hardware that solves an extremely complex computational math problem. The first computer to find the solution to the problem receives the next block of bitcoins and the process begins again. Cryptocurrency mining is painstaking, costly, and only sporadically rewarding. Nonetheless, mining has a magnetic appeal for many investors who are interested in cryptocurrency because of the fact that miners receive rewards for their work with crypto tokens. This may be because entrepreneurial types see mining as pennies from heaven, like California gold prospectors in 1849. And if you are technologically inclined, why not do it? The bitcoin reward that miners receive is an incentive that motivates people to assist in the primary purpose of mining, to legitimize and monitor Bitcoin transactions, ensuring their validity. Because many users all over the world share these responsibilities, Bitcoin is a \"decentralized\" cryptocurrency, or one that does not rely on any central authority like a central bank or government to oversee its regulation.'],\n",

ETH works as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts. Ethereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014. The project team managed to raise $18.3 million in Bitcoin, and Ethereum’s price in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was $0.311, with over 60 million Ether sold. Taking Ethereum’s price now, this puts the return on investment (ROI) at an annualized rate of over 270%, essentially almost quadrupling your investment every year since the summer of 2014. The Ethereum Foundation officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015, under the prototype codenamed “Frontier.” Since then, there has been several network updates — “Constantinople” on Feb. 28, 2019, “Istanbul” on Dec. 8, 2019, “Muir Glacier” on Jan. 2, 2020, “Berlin” on April 14, 2021, and most recently on Aug. 5, 2021, the “London” hard fork.

Russian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin is perhaps the best known of the bunch. He authored the original white paper that first described Ethereum in 2013 and still works on improving the platform to this day. Prior to ETH, Buterin co-founded and wrote for the Bitcoin Magazine news website. British programmer Gavin Wood is arguably the second most important co-founder of ETH, as he coded the first technical implementation of Ethereum in the C++ programming language, proposed Ethereum’s native programming language Solidity and was the first chief technology officer of the Ethereum Foundation. Before Ethereum, Wood was a research scientist at Microsoft. Afterward, he moved on to establish the Web3 Foundation. Among the other co-founders of Ethereum are - Anthony Di Iorio, who underwrote the project during its early stage of development. - Charles Hoskinson, who played the principal role in establishing the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation and its legal framework. - Mihai Alisie, who provided assistance in establishing the Ethereum Foundation. - Joseph Lubin, a Canadian entrepreneur, who, like Di Iorio, has helped fund Ethereum during its early days, and later founded an incubator for startups based on ETH called ConsenSys. - Amir Chetrit, who helped co-found Ethereum but stepped away from it early into the development.

The list includes Mihai Alisie Alisie, due to his previous partnership with Buterin and his expertise in economic cybernetics, was a member of the founding team of Ethereum. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland. He helped set up a legal framework for the pre-sale of Ether and later emerged as the vice president of the Ethereum Foundation. In 2015, Alisie set out to start his own Ethereum-based project, named Akasha. Anthony Di lorio Anthony Di lorio was one of the financial sponsors of the Ethereum startup. He then took a back seat after the team decided to opt for a non-profit business principle. Following his decision to opt for a passive role, Di lorio emerged as the chief digital officer of the Toronto Stock Exchange for a short while before founding Decentral, the company behind Jaxx digital wallet. Amir Chetrit Amir Chetrit had a working relationship with Buterin during his stint at Colored Coins. Buterin asked Chetrit to join the founding team in December 2013. However, at a co-founder meeting in June 2014, other team members and Ethereum developers questioned the lack of input from Chetrit. It was at this meeting that Chetrit agreed to step down active involvement with Ethereum development while retaining his position as a co-founder. Charles Hoskinson Charles Hoskinson emerged as the CEO of the Ethereum startup in December 2013 only for him to hit the exit button after the team decided to promote a non-profit architecture for the organization. This spurred Hoskinson to create his version of a programmable blockchain ecosystem called Cardano. The platform is currently considered one of the major rival blockchains to Ethereum’s throne. Gavin Wood Gavin Wood was one of the core contributors during Ethereum’s early stage of development. He earned the position of co-founder as a result of his programming contributions. He created the first Ethereum testnet and even published the project’s yellow paper — the technical specification of the original white paper published by Buterin. Wood also proposed the ecosystem’s native programming language, Solidity. These days, Wood is busy working on Web3 Foundation and its flagship product, Polkadot. Jeffrey Wilcke Like Wood, Wilcke became a co-founder solely because of his programming contributions. He was working on MasterCoin when he discovered Ethereum. He began writing Google Go’s version of the platform independently. He is currently focusing on his game development studio, Grid Games. Joseph Lubin Before joining the Ethereum team, Joseph Lubin had amassed a wealth of experience in various fields. He later launched his own for-profit company, ConsenSys, which serves as an incubator for blockchain startups looking to use the Ethereum ecosystem.

Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically execute the actions necessary to fulfill an agreement between several parties on the internet. They were designed to reduce the need for trusted intermediates between contractors, thus reducing transaction costs while also increasing transaction reliability. Ethereum’s principal innovation was designing a platform that allowed it to execute smart contracts using the blockchain, which further reinforces the already existing benefits of smart contract technology. Ethereum’s blockchain was designed, according to co-founder Gavin Wood, as a sort of “one computer for the entire planet,” theoretically able to make any program more robust, censorship-resistant and less prone to fraud by running it on a globally distributed network of public nodes. In addition to smart contracts, Ethereum’s blockchain is able to host other cryptocurrencies, called “tokens,” through the use of its ERC-20 compatibility standard. In fact, this has been the most common use for the ETH platform so far. To date, more than 280,000 ERC-20-compliant tokens have been launched. Over 40 of these make the top-100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, for example, USDT, LINK and BNB. Since the emergence of Play2Earn games, there has been a substantial increase in interest in the ETH to PHP price.'],\n",

It is essentially the Web3 version of DNS, short for domain name service. In its original state, a cryptocurrency address consists of a long string of numbers and letters designed to be read by computers. It may look like this — “0xDC25EF3F5B8A186998338A2ADA83795FBA2D695E” — making it confusing at times to read, and in some cases even leading to loss of funds. ENS provides a solution to this problem of long and confusing crypto addresses by assigning human-readable names to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, metadata, other cryptocurrency addresses and content hashes. With ENS, the long address above could become something as simple as “Alice.eth,” and you can receive any type of cryptocurrency or NFT via your ENS domain. ENS is based on two Ethereum smart contracts. The first is the ENS registry, which records three critical pieces of information - the owner of the domain, the resolver for the domain and the caching time for all records under the domain. The second smart contract is the Resolver, which translates the domain name to a machine-readable address and vice-versa. It is worth adding that in addition to integrating with .eth names, ENS also supports the most popular DNS names, including .com, .org, .io, .app and several others.'],\n",

As already mentioned, there are plans to transition to a proof-of-stake algorithm in order to boost the platform’s scalability and add a number of new features. The development team has already begun the transition process to ETH 2.0, implementing some upgrades along the way, including the London hard fork. The London upgrade went live in August 2021. It included five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), namely EIP-3529, EIP-3198, EIP-3541, and most notably EIP-1559 and EIP-3554.

Before the upgrade, users had to participate in an open auction for their transactions to be picked up by a miner. This process is known as a “first-price auction,” and as expected, the highest bidder wins. With EIP-1559, this process is handled by an automated bidding system, and there is a set “base fee” for transactions to be included in the next block. This fee varies based on how congested the network is. Furthermore, users who wish to speed up their transactions can pay a “priority fee” to a miner for faster inclusion. EIP-1559 also introduces a fee-burning mechanism. A part of every transaction fee (the base fee) is burned and removed out of circulation. This is intended to lower the circulating supply of Ether and potentially increase the value of the token over time.

This switch has been in the Ethereum roadmap since the network's inception and would see a new consensus mechanism, as well as introduce sharding as a scaling solution. The current Ethereum chain will become the Beacon Chain and serve as a settlement layer for smart contract interactions on other chains. In late 2021, Ethereum's Arrow Glacier update was delayed to June 2022. Until then, Vitalik Buterin expects the road to the network's endgame to be shaped by optimistic rollups and Zk-rollups. In January 2022, the Ethereum Foundation announced the decision to remove the “Ethereum 2.0” terminology to “save all future users from navigating this confusing mental model.” It went on to explain that the previously-referred-to terms of “Ethereum 1.0” would be branded the “execution layer,” while “Ethereum 2.0” will be called the “consensus layer”. This is ultimately to provide a more accurate version of the Ethereum roadmap.

The Merge is scheduled to go ahead on Sept. 15, 2022, with the merge of the Goerli testnet successfully completed on Aug. 11, 2022. The Merge implements several critical changes to Ethereum. First, it merges the existing PoW Ethereum mainnet with the Beacon Chain, a PoS chain. Together, the two chains will form the new proof-of-stake Ethereum, which will consist of a consensus layer and an execution layer. The consensus layer will synchronize the chain state across the network, while the execution layer handles transactions and block production. Second, the Merge significantly reduces ETH issuance. This has been dubbed the \"triple halving\" in a nod to the Bitcoin halving, since the Merge reduces ETH issuance by 90%. With more than 14M ETH already staked, ETH could very well become deflationary after the transition. Furthermore, stakers are expected to earn between 8% and 12% APR at current projections. Staked ETH will not be withdrawable immediately after the Merge — it will only be enabled after the Shanghai upgrade, estimated to be 6 to 12 months later. Learn more about the common misconceptions of Ethereum post-Merge. The Merge will not increase transaction throughput or reduce gas fees, as the block production rate stays roughly the same at 12 seconds (currently 13 seconds). It will also not enable on-chain governance, with protocol changes still discussed and decided off-chain through stakeholders. Importantly, the transition to PoS is expected to reduce Ethereum\\'s annual energy consumption from 112 TWh/yr to only 0.01 TWh/yr — a 99.9% drop. This reduction prompted investors to expect an influx of institutional money in a \"greener\" Ethereum.

While most companies targeted by the SEC in a similar matter chose to settle, Ripple decided to fight. The outcome of the lawsuit will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications in the crypto space. If Ripple prevails, the SEC could lose some of its credibility, giving other crypto-based companies the confidence to revolt.

Using Polygon, one can create optimistic rollup chains, ZK rollup chains, stand alone chains or any other kind of infra required by the developer. Polygon effectively transforms Ethereum into a full-fledged multi-chain system (aka Internet of Blockchains). This multi-chain system is akin to other ones such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche etc. with the advantages of Ethereum’s security, vibrant ecosystem and openness. The $MATIC token will continue to exist and will play an increasingly important role, securing the system and enabling governance. Polygon (formerly Matic Network) is a Layer 2 scaling solution backed by Binance and Coinbase. The project seeks to stimulate mass adoption of cryptocurrencies by resolving the problems of scalability on many blockchains. Polygon combines the Plasma Framework and the proof-of-stake blockchain architecture. The Plasma framework used by Polygon as proposed by the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, allows for the easy execution of scalable and autonomous smart contracts. Nothing will change for the existing ecosystem built on the Plasma-POS chain. With Polygon, new features are being built around the existing proven technology to expand the ability to cater to diverse needs from the developer ecosystem. Polygon will continue to develop the core technology so that it can scale to a larger ecosystem. Polygon boasts of up to 65,000 transactions per second on a single side chain, along with a respectable block confirmation time of less than two seconds. The framework also allows for the creation of globally available decentralized financial applications on a single foundational blockchain. The Plasma framework gives Polygon the potential of housing an unlimited number of decentralized applications on their infrastructure without experiencing the normal drawbacks common on proof-of-work blockchains. So far, Polygon has attracted more than 50 DApps to its PoS-secured Ethereum sidechain. MATIC, the native tokens of Polygon, is an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum blockchain. The tokens are used for payment services on Polygon and as a settlement currency between users who operate within the Polygon ecosystem.

Polkadot was designed to provide a foundation for a decentralized internet of blockchains, also known as Web3. Polkadot is known as a layer-0 metaprotocol because it underlies and describes a format for a network of layer 1 blockchains known as parachains (parallel chains). As a metaprotocol, Polkadot is also capable of autonomously and forklessly updating its own codebase via on-chain governance according to the will of its token holder community. Polkadot provides a foundation to support a decentralized web, controlled by its users, and to simplify the creation of new applications, institutions and services. The Polkadot protocol can connect public and private chains, permissionless networks, oracles and future technologies, allowing these independent blockchains to trustlessly share information and transactions through the Polkadot Relay Chain (explained further down). Polkadot’s native DOT token serves three clear purposes - staking for operations and security, facilitating network governance, and bonding tokens to connect parachains . Polkadot has four core components - 1) Relay Chain. Polkadot’s “heart,” helping to create consensus, interoperability and shared security across the network of different chains; 2) Parachains. independent chains that can have their own tokens and be optimized for specific use cases; 3) Parathreads. similar to parachains but with flexible connectivity based on an economical pay-as-you-go model;4) Bridges. allow parachains and parathreads to connect and communicate with external blockchains like Ethereum.'],\n",

The team argued that the current governance system has elements of centralization. For example, the Polkadot Council, a body of executives, had sole control over some decision-making processes, including how the network\\'s treasury is spent. To this end, the new development is replacing the existing governance infrastructure with a framework in the form of a \"referendum.\" In other words, the planned upgrade will introduce a voting system allowing anyone to submit proposals and have them approved. Called Governorship version 2 or Gov2, this upgrade allegedly eliminates all forms of preferential first-class citizenry like the Technical Committee and the Polkadot Council. With this, the protocol aims to reduce the concentration of voting power by replacing the Technical Committee with the Polkadot Fellowship, designed to accommodate up to tens of thousands of members and feature a lower barrier for entry. The members are ranked to showcase the degree the protocol expects each participant to make informed decisions and support proposals that are in the best interest of the network. Another core component of the upgrade is the Origins and Tracks system. This mechanism will help grade the importance of a proposal and determine the appropriate way to treat them. As such, the network can implement suitable safeguards to ensure that the decision-making process is decentralized and fair. For instance, proposals tagged as Root Origins are the most sensitive. Such proposals undergo longer and more scrutinized consideration periods, with a higher approval threshold. Also, the system ensures that only one hypersensitive proposal can be deliberated on at a time. On the other hand, proposals with less sensitive Origins have shorter consideration periods with a lower approval threshold. Put simply, the grade of the importance of proposals will determine the type of safeguards assigned to them and the length of the decision-making process they undergo. Gov2 will first be tested on Kusama, an experimental development environment for testing applications, before it goes live on Polkadot. Once the testing and audit phase is complete, the team will submit the proposal to launch Gov2 on the Polkadot network.'],\n",

              "   'Litecoin (LTC) is a cryptocurrency that was designed to provide fast, secure and low-cost payments by leveraging the unique properties of blockchain technology. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Litecoin. The cryptocurrency was created based on the Bitcoin (BTC) protocol, but it differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used, hard cap, block transaction times and a few other factors. Litecoin has a block time of just 2.5 minutes and extremely low transaction fees, making it suitable for micro-transactions and point-of-sale payments. Litecoin was released via an open-source client on GitHub on Oct. 7, 2011, and the Litecoin Network went live five days later on Oct. 13, 2011. Since then, it has exploded in both usage and acceptance among merchants and has counted among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization for most of its existence. The cryptocurrency was created by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee, who intended Litecoin to be a \"lite version of Bitcoin,\" in that it features many of the same properties as Bitcoin—albeit lighter in weight.'],\n",

Charlie Lee, also known as “Chocobo,” is an early Bitcoin miner and computer scientist, who was a former software engineer for Google. In addition, Charlie Lee held the role of director of engineering at Coinbase between 2015 and 2017 before moving on to other ventures. Today, Charlie Lee is an outspoken advocate of cryptocurrencies and is the managing director of the Litecoin Foundation—a non-profit organization that works alongside the Litecoin Core Development team to help advance Litecoin. Besides Lee, the Litecoin Foundation also includes three other individuals on the board of directors - Xinxi Wang, Alan Austin and Zing Yang — all of which are accomplished in their own right.'],\n",

              "   'MimbleWimble is an upgrade enabling users to achieve much-needed privacy while transacting on the network. The MimbleWimble upgrade was first proposed in November 2019 through a Litecoin Improvement Proposal. At the time, the Litecoin developers aimed to further focus on improving anonymity between senders and receivers. Following the MimbleWimble upgrade at Litecoin block 2,257,920, users could opt for moe transaction privacy and explore other benefits, including blocks containing less needless transaction data. More specifically, long transactions are broken down into a single transfer by recording one input-output pair. The MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB) upgrade was successfully activated on May 19, 2022. However, the upgrade puts Litecoin in the crosshairs of regulators who do not take kindly to privacy-capable cryptocurrencies. Some effects of the upgrade became rather apparent when several South Korean exchanges started delisting Litecoin from their platforms shortly after the MWEB upgrade went into effect. Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit and Gopax have delisted LTC over the MimbleWimble upgrade, due to how it makes it impossible for these companies to adhere to the Act on the Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information. Per South Korean regulation, crypto exchanges need to mitigate money laundering and illicit activities at all costs. That means removing any currencies that provide users with additional privacy or anonymity.'],\n",

              "   'TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain-based operating system developed by the Tron Foundation and launched in 2017. Originally TRX tokens were ERC-20-based tokens deployed on Ethereum, but a year later they were moved to their own network. Initially, the project was created with the aim of providing full ownership rights to makers of digital content. The main goal is to help content creators (who receive only a small part of the income) and encourage them with more rewards for their work. invite content consumers to reward content makers directly (without intermediaries like YouTube, Facebook or Apple). The TRON software supports smart contracts, various kinds of blockchain systems, and decentralized applications aka dApps. The cryptocurrency platform uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin (BTC), namely UTXO. Transactions take place in a public ledger, where users can track the history of operations. Therefore, the platform was built to create a decentralized Internet and serves as a tool for developers to create dApps, acting as an alternative to Ethereum. Anyone can create dApps on the TRON network, offer content, and in return receive digital assets as compensation for their efforts. The ability to create content and share it openly without hesitation regarding transaction fees is an undeniable advantage of TRON. Network principles - The data hosted on the TRON network is free with no central authority. Content creators receive TRX tokens - a reward for their intellectual labour; TRON supports the creation of coins by content makers, which can be used in their own developed applications; TRON also carries out decentralized games on the network, players can encourage and reward creators with digital assets directly.'],\n",

Below are specific details to individual tax jurisdictions. U.S. The IRS issued guidance on the treatment of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in their March 2014-21 Notice [3]. The notice clarified the position that the IRS treats digital currencies as capital assets and are therefore subject to capital gains taxes. Any disposition of these digital currencies, including trading and spending, is a tax event and capital gains must be calculated in USD. When spending, the fair value should be used as the proceeds value. The IRS also clarified that mining is treated as immediate income at the fair or market value of those mined coins on their date of receipt. While the IRS Notice does confirm that Bitcoin is taxed as property rather than a currency, there are still some unresolved issues. For instance, how should a mined alt-coin income value be determined is there is no direct fiat market, and do alt-coins benefit from Like-Kind Exchanges [4]. There is a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) filing requirement for financial accounts in a foreign country when the aggregate value of the accounts exceeded $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. While the value of Bitcoins themselves don't count towards the FBAR threshold[5], there is the possibility that requirement applies to cash held in non-US bitcoin exchanges or wallet services[6]. An additional topic that may have a connection to Bitcoin is the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) filing requirement in the U.S.[7].

Whether you decide to form a corporation, register as an LLC, or simply operate as a private individual (sole proprietorship), the basic concept of tax treatment for Bitcoins is going to remain the same. For example, you will report gross income, deduct expenses, and have a net taxable income on which you will be required to pay income tax, as well as possibly self employment tax depending on how your mining business is set up.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What expenses can I deduct/expense/itemize if I set up a Bitcoin mining operation?', 'completion': ' That depends on your situation. Generally speaking, though, you can deduct business expenses that are ordinary and necessary. Buying video cards would be both of these, buying a big screen TV to watch while mining would be neither.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Are my bitcoins taxed as income, or as capital gains?', 'completion': ' Income that is earned through the exchange of services with another person, whether in the form of bitcoins, dollars, or barter; is included in gross income, and would be subject to income tax at applicable rates. Also these bitcoins could be subject to self employment tax. In some jurisdictions, income earned through the process of buying and selling bitcoins would also be included in gross income, but would be treated as capital gains. The above interpretation is based on the assumption bitcoins are treated as a store of value such as gold, or other such commodity. If instead they are treated as a currency or debt, the full gain could be taxed based on market value at the end of each tax year. 3858 IRS Ends Currency ETN Advantage Simply put, the IRS never considers currency a long-term investment. Consequently, if bitcoins are treated as a currency, you will be taxed the same as holding an account in any non-functional (foreign) currency.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'How are Bitcoins that I have mined treated for tax purposes?', 'completion': ' This is a tricky question, in that bitcoins are really the first digital currency that was created in this manner and actually have a significant value in relation to other currencies. Essentially it is somewhat uncharted territory. Literally bitcoins, and even digital currencies are so new, that there is little to no precedent for some aspects of bitcoin mining, from a tax perspective. Since Bitcoins are currently traded in various online marketplaces, when someone receives a Bitcoin, they can reasonably calculate it’s value in the local currency. Because of this, it is possible that the taxing authority will treat the receipt of a Bitcoin through a mining pool, or from an individual mining operation, as a taxable event. At that time, the taxpayer would be required to estimate the value of the Bitcoins in dollars and record that amount. This would have to be done either daily or weekly depending on the value of the Bitcoins if their value keeps fluctuating as much as it has the past few weeks. These amounts would be recorded as revenue from bitcoin mining operations and would be taxable less allowed expenses. When selling mined Bitcoins, however, you would also be taxed on the increase between the value you recorded them at when you first received them, and the value you sold them for. Another possibility is that the government will consider mined Bitcoins ‘intangible personal property’. As a rule, however, financial instruments are excluded from this particular category. The question is, are bitcoins a financial instrument, or rather, will the taxing authority consider them a financial instrument? We will have to wait and see if bitcoins become popular enough for a position to be taken on that.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What is Bitcoin?', 'completion': ' Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Are bitcoins taxable if I earned them by doing a service for someone else, or received them in exchange for something?', 'completion': ' Anything that you receive as payment for goods or services is generally taxable income unless it is specifically exempted. That means, if you mow your neighbor’s lawn, it doesn’t matter if he pays you $20 in cash, or $20 worth of bitcoins. (Or $20 worth of tomatoes for that matter) In many jurisdictions, you are still legally required to report that as income. When using Bitcoin for payment the taxing authorities may be less likely to be aware of the payments but try to mow 10,000 neighbor’s lawns and not report the income and you will be much more likely to get caught.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'WHAT IS CRYPTO MINING?', 'completion': ' Most people think of crypto mining simply as a way of creating new coins. Crypto mining, however, also involves validating cryptocurrency transactions on a blockchain network and adding them to a distributed ledger.  Most importantly, crypto mining prevents the double-spending of digital currency on a distributed network. Like physical currencies, when one member spends cryptocurrency, the digital ledger must be updated by debiting one account and crediting the other. However, the challenge of a digital currency is that digital platforms are easily manipulated. Bitcoin’s distributed ledger, therefore, only allows verified miners to update transactions on the digital ledger. This gives miners the extra responsibility of securing the network from double-spending. Meanwhile, new coins are generated to reward miners for their work in securing the network. Since distributed ledgers lack a centralized authority, the mining process is crucial for validating transactions. Miners are, therefore, incentivized to secure the network by participating in the transaction validation process that increases their chances of winning newly minted coins. In order to ensure that only verified crypto miners can mine and validate transactions, a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol has been put into place. PoW also secures the network from any external attacks.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What is PROOF-OF-WORK?', 'completion': ' Crypto mining is somewhat similar to mining precious metals. While miners of precious metals will unearth gold, silver, or diamonds, crypto miners will trigger the release of new coins into circulation. For miners to be rewarded with new coins, they need to deploy machines that solve complex mathematical equations in the form of cryptographic hashes. A hash is a truncated digital signature of a chunk of data. Hashes are generated to secure data transferred on a public network. Miners compete with their peers to zero in on a hash value generated by a crypto coin transaction, and the first miner to crack the code gets to add the block to the ledger and receive the reward. Each block uses a hash function to refer to the previous block, forming an unbroken chain of blocks that leads back to the first block. For this reason, peers on the network can easily verify whether certain blocks are valid and whether the miners who validated each block properly solved the hash to receive the reward. Over time, as miners deploy more advanced machines to solve PoW, the difficulty of equations on the network increases. At the same time, competition among miners rises, increasing the scarcity of cryptocurrency as a result.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'HOW TO START MINING CRYPTOCURRENCIES?', 'completion': ' Mining cryptocurrencies requires computers with special software specifically designed to solve complicated, cryptographic mathematic equations. In the technology’s early days, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could be mined with a simple CPU chip on a home computer. Over the years, however, CPU chips have become impractical for mining most cryptocurrencies due to the increasing difficulty levels. Today, mining cryptocurrencies requires a specialized GPU or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miner. In addition, the GPUs in the mining rig must be connected to a reliable internet connection at all times. Each crypto miner is also required to be a member of an online crypto mining pool as well.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'DIFFERENT METHODS OF MINING CRYPTOCURRENCIES', 'completion': ' Different methods of mining cryptocurrencies require different amounts of time. In the technology’s early days, for example, CPU mining was the go-to option for most miners. However, many find CPU mining to be too slow and impractical today because it takes months to accrue even a small amount of profit, given the high electrical and cooling costs and increased difficulty across the board. GPU mining is another method of mining cryptocurrencies. It maximizes computational power by bringing together a set of GPUs under one mining rig. For GPU mining, a motherboard and cooling system is required for the rig. Similarly, ASIC mining is yet another method of mining cryptocurrencies. Unlike GPU miners, ASIC miners are specifically designed to mine cryptocurrencies, so they produce more cryptocurrency units than GPUs. However, they are expensive, meaning that, as mining difficulty increases, they quickly become obsolete. Given the ever-increasing costs of GPU  and ASIC mining, cloud mining is becoming increasingly popular. Cloud mining allows individual miners to leverage the power of major corporations and dedicated crypto-mining facilities. Individual crypto miners can identify both free and paid cloud mining hosts online and rent a mining rig for a specific amount of time. This method is the most hands-free way to mine cryptocurrencies.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'How to mine cyrptocurrencies more efficiently with MINING POOLS', 'completion': ' Mining pools allow miners to combine their computational resources in order to increase their chances of finding and mining blocks on a blockchain. If a mining pool succeeds, the reward is distributed across the mining pool, in proportion to the amount of resources that each miner contributed to the pool. Most crypto mining applications come with a mining pool; however, crypto enthusiasts now also join together online to create their own mining pools. Because some pools earn more rewards than others, miners are free to change pools whenever they need to. Miners consider official crypto mining pools more reliable since they receive frequent upgrades by their host companies, as well as regular technical support. The best place to find mining pools is CryptoCompare, where miners can compare different mining pools based on their reliability, profitability, and the coin that they want to mine.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'IS CRYPTO MINING WORTH IT?', 'completion': ' Determining whether crypto mining is worthwhile depends on several factors. Whether a prospective miner chooses a CPU, GPU, ASIC miner, or cloud mining, the most important factors to consider are the mining rig’s hash rate, electric power consumption, and overall costs. Generally, crypto-mining machines consume a considerable amount of electricity and emit significant heat. For instance, the average ASIC miner will use about 72 terawatts of power to create a bitcoin in about ten minutes. These figures continue to change as technology advances and mining difficulty increases. Even though the price of the machine matters, it is just as important to consider electricity consumption, electricity costs in the area, and cooling costs, especially with GPU and ASIC mining rigs. It is also important to consider the level of difficulty for the cryptocurrency that an individual wants to mine, in order to determine whether the operation would even be profitable.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'THE TAX IMPLICATIONS OF CRYPTO MINING', 'completion': ' The taxation of crypto mining remains an important consideration. Crypto miners will generally face tax consequences (1) when they are rewarded with cryptocurrency for performing mining activities, and (2) when they sell or exchange the reward tokens. With respect to (1), the IRS has issued Notice 2014-21 which directly addresses the tax implications of crypto mining. Under the Notice, a miner will recognize gross income upon receipt of the reward tokens in an amount equal to the fair market value of the coins at the time of receipt. Additionally, if a taxpayer’s mining activities constitute a trade or business or the taxpayer undertakes such activities as an independent contractor, the reward tokens/virtual currency payments are deemed to be self-employment income and accordingly, subject to self-employment taxes. Similarly, if a taxpayer performs mining activities as an employee, payments made in cryptocurrency are treated as wages subject to federal income tax withholding of Social Security/Medicare and unemployment taxes.

Under the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), crypto miners are considered money transmitters, so they may be subject to the laws that govern that activity. In Israel, for instance, crypto mining is treated as a business and is subject to corporate income tax. In India and elsewhere, regulatory uncertainty persists, although Canada and the United States appear friendly to crypto mining. However, apart from jurisdictions that have specifically banned cryptocurrency-related activities, very few countries prohibit crypto mining.

It is also the way the network confirms new transactions and is a critical component of the blockchain ledger\\'s maintenance and development. \"Mining\" is performed using sophisticated hardware that solves an extremely complex computational math problem. The first computer to find the solution to the problem receives the next block of bitcoins and the process begins again. Cryptocurrency mining is painstaking, costly, and only sporadically rewarding. Nonetheless, mining has a magnetic appeal for many investors who are interested in cryptocurrency because of the fact that miners receive rewards for their work with crypto tokens. This may be because entrepreneurial types see mining as pennies from heaven, like California gold prospectors in 1849. And if you are technologically inclined, why not do it? The bitcoin reward that miners receive is an incentive that motivates people to assist in the primary purpose of mining, to legitimize and monitor Bitcoin transactions, ensuring their validity. Because many users all over the world share these responsibilities, Bitcoin is a \"decentralized\" cryptocurrency, or one that does not rely on any central authority like a central bank or government to oversee its regulation.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Is Ethereum (ETH)?', 'completion': ' Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts. Ethereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014. The project team managed to raise $18.3 million in Bitcoin, and Ethereum’s price in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was $0.311, with over 60 million Ether sold. Taking Ethereum’s price now, this puts the return on investment (ROI) at an annualized rate of over 270%, essentially almost quadrupling your investment every year since the summer of 2014. The Ethereum Foundation officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015, under the prototype codenamed “Frontier.” Since then, there has been several network updates — “Constantinople” on Feb. 28, 2019, “Istanbul” on Dec. 8, 2019, “Muir Glacier” on Jan. 2, 2020, “Berlin” on April 14, 2021, and most recently on Aug. 5, 2021, the “London” hard fork. Ethereum’s own purported goal is to become a global platform for decentralized applications, allowing users from all over the world to write and run software that is resistant to censorship, downtime and fraud.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Who Are the Founders of Ethereum?', 'completion': ' Ethereum has a total of eight co-founders — an unusually large number for a crypto project. They first met on June 7, 2014, in Zug, Switzerland. Russian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin is perhaps the best known of the bunch. He authored the original white paper that first described Ethereum in 2013 and still works on improving the platform to this day. Prior to ETH, Buterin co-founded and wrote for the Bitcoin Magazine news website. British programmer Gavin Wood is arguably the second most important co-founder of ETH, as he coded the first technical implementation of Ethereum in the C++ programming language, proposed Ethereum’s native programming language Solidity and was the first chief technology officer of the Ethereum Foundation. Before Ethereum, Wood was a research scientist at Microsoft. Afterward, he moved on to establish the Web3 Foundation. Among the other co-founders of Ethereum are - Anthony Di Iorio, who underwrote the project during its early stage of development. - Charles Hoskinson, who played the principal role in establishing the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation and its legal framework. - Mihai Alisie, who provided assistance in establishing the Ethereum Foundation. - Joseph Lubin, a Canadian entrepreneur, who, like Di Iorio, has helped fund Ethereum during its early days, and later founded an incubator for startups based on ETH called ConsenSys. - Amir Chetrit, who helped co-found Ethereum but stepped away from it early into the development. Ethereum had eight co-founders — but only Vitalik Buterin is still working on the second-largest crypto asset.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Who Are the Co-founders of Ethereum?', 'completion': ' At the early stage of development, Vitalik Buterin onboarded top developers and entrepreneurs to steer the formative stage of Ethereum. These individuals became co-founders of the project and contributed their quota to its success. The list includes Mihai Alisie Alisie, due to his previous partnership with Buterin and his expertise in economic cybernetics, was a member of the founding team of Ethereum. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland. He helped set up a legal framework for the pre-sale of Ether and later emerged as the vice president of the Ethereum Foundation. In 2015, Alisie set out to start his own Ethereum-based project, named Akasha. Anthony Di lorio Anthony Di lorio was one of the financial sponsors of the Ethereum startup. He then took a back seat after the team decided to opt for a non-profit business principle. Following his decision to opt for a passive role, Di lorio emerged as the chief digital officer of the Toronto Stock Exchange for a short while before founding Decentral, the company behind Jaxx digital wallet. Amir Chetrit Amir Chetrit had a working relationship with Buterin during his stint at Colored Coins. Buterin asked Chetrit to join the founding team in December 2013. However, at a co-founder meeting in June 2014, other team members and Ethereum developers questioned the lack of input from Chetrit. It was at this meeting that Chetrit agreed to step down active involvement with Ethereum development while retaining his position as a co-founder. Charles Hoskinson Charles Hoskinson emerged as the CEO of the Ethereum startup in December 2013 only for him to hit the exit button after the team decided to promote a non-profit architecture for the organization. This spurred Hoskinson to create his version of a programmable blockchain ecosystem called Cardano. The platform is currently considered one of the major rival blockchains to Ethereum’s throne. Gavin Wood Gavin Wood was one of the core contributors during Ethereum’s early stage of development. He earned the position of co-founder as a result of his programming contributions. He created the first Ethereum testnet and even published the project’s yellow paper — the technical specification of the original white paper published by Buterin. Wood also proposed the ecosystem’s native programming language, Solidity. These days, Wood is busy working on Web3 Foundation and its flagship product, Polkadot. Jeffrey Wilcke Like Wood, Wilcke became a co-founder solely because of his programming contributions. He was working on MasterCoin when he discovered Ethereum. He began writing Google Go’s version of the platform independently. He is currently focusing on his game development studio, Grid Games. Joseph Lubin Before joining the Ethereum team, Joseph Lubin had amassed a wealth of experience in various fields. He later launched his own for-profit company, ConsenSys, which serves as an incubator for blockchain startups looking to use the Ethereum ecosystem. He has also been influential in some of the high-profile partnerships that Ethereum has secured over the years.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Makes Ethereum Unique?', 'completion': ' Ethereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform. Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically execute the actions necessary to fulfill an agreement between several parties on the internet. They were designed to reduce the need for trusted intermediates between contractors, thus reducing transaction costs while also increasing transaction reliability. Ethereum’s principal innovation was designing a platform that allowed it to execute smart contracts using the blockchain, which further reinforces the already existing benefits of smart contract technology. Ethereum’s blockchain was designed, according to co-founder Gavin Wood, as a sort of “one computer for the entire planet,” theoretically able to make any program more robust, censorship-resistant and less prone to fraud by running it on a globally distributed network of public nodes. In addition to smart contracts, Ethereum’s blockchain is able to host other cryptocurrencies, called “tokens,” through the use of its ERC-20 compatibility standard. In fact, this has been the most common use for the ETH platform so far. To date, more than 280,000 ERC-20-compliant tokens have been launched. Over 40 of these make the top-100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, for example, USDT, LINK and BNB. Since the emergence of Play2Earn games, there has been a substantial increase in interest in the ETH to PHP price.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What is Ethereum Name Service?', 'completion': ' Ethereum Name Service, aka ENS, is a distributed and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. It is essentially the Web3 version of DNS, short for domain name service. In its original state, a cryptocurrency address consists of a long string of numbers and letters designed to be read by computers. It may look like this — “0xDC25EF3F5B8A186998338A2ADA83795FBA2D695E” — making it confusing at times to read, and in some cases even leading to loss of funds. ENS provides a solution to this problem of long and confusing crypto addresses by assigning human-readable names to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, metadata, other cryptocurrency addresses and content hashes. With ENS, the long address above could become something as simple as “Alice.eth,” and you can receive any type of cryptocurrency or NFT via your ENS domain. ENS is based on two Ethereum smart contracts. The first is the ENS registry, which records three critical pieces of information - the owner of the domain, the resolver for the domain and the caching time for all records under the domain. The second smart contract is the Resolver, which translates the domain name to a machine-readable address and vice-versa. It is worth adding that in addition to integrating with .eth names, ENS also supports the most popular DNS names, including .com, .org, .io, .app and several others.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What is an Ethereum Killer?', 'completion': ' Ethereum to USD Chart 1D 7D 1M 3M 1Y YTD ALL LOG USD Want more data?

In May 2021, the average transaction fee of the network peaked at $71.72. In addition to the high cost of transactions, the leading altcoin also suffers from scalability issues. As already mentioned, there are plans to transition to a proof-of-stake algorithm in order to boost the platform’s scalability and add a number of new features. The development team has already begun the transition process to ETH 2.0, implementing some upgrades along the way, including the London hard fork. The London upgrade went live in August 2021. It included five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), namely EIP-3529, EIP-3198, EIP-3541, and most notably EIP-1559 and EIP-3554. EIP-1559 is arguably the most popular upgrade out of all the EIPs.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Is EIP-1559?', 'completion': ' The EIP-1559 upgrade introduces a mechanism that changes the way gas fees are estimated on the Ethereum blockchain. Before the upgrade, users had to participate in an open auction for their transactions to be picked up by a miner. This process is known as a “first-price auction,” and as expected, the highest bidder wins. With EIP-1559, this process is handled by an automated bidding system, and there is a set “base fee” for transactions to be included in the next block. This fee varies based on how congested the network is. Furthermore, users who wish to speed up their transactions can pay a “priority fee” to a miner for faster inclusion. EIP-1559 also introduces a fee-burning mechanism. A part of every transaction fee (the base fee) is burned and removed out of circulation. This is intended to lower the circulating supply of Ether and potentially increase the value of the token over time. Interestingly, less than two months after the London upgrade was implemented, the network had burned over $1 billion worth of Ether.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Ethereum 2.0', 'completion': \" In 2022, Ethereum plans to switch to proof-of-stake with its Ethereum 2.0 update. This switch has been in the Ethereum roadmap since the network's inception and would see a new consensus mechanism, as well as introduce sharding as a scaling solution. The current Ethereum chain will become the Beacon Chain and serve as a settlement layer for smart contract interactions on other chains. In late 2021, Ethereum's Arrow Glacier update was delayed to June 2022. Until then, Vitalik Buterin expects the road to the network's endgame to be shaped by optimistic rollups and Zk-rollups. In January 2022, the Ethereum Foundation announced the decision to remove the “Ethereum 2.0” terminology to “save all future users from navigating this confusing mental model.” It went on to explain that the previously-referred-to terms of “Ethereum 1.0” would be branded the “execution layer,” while “Ethereum 2.0” will be called the “consensus layer”. This is ultimately to provide a more accurate version of the Ethereum roadmap. In an update on the progress of the Merge, on April 13, 2022, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko tweeted an update on the progress of the Merge, stating that they are “definitely in the final chapter of PoW on Ethereum.” He also mentioned that users can expect it to occur a few months after June, although no exact date was provided.

The Merge is scheduled to go ahead on Sept. 15, 2022, with the merge of the Goerli testnet successfully completed on Aug. 11, 2022. The Merge implements several critical changes to Ethereum. First, it merges the existing PoW Ethereum mainnet with the Beacon Chain, a PoS chain. Together, the two chains will form the new proof-of-stake Ethereum, which will consist of a consensus layer and an execution layer. The consensus layer will synchronize the chain state across the network, while the execution layer handles transactions and block production. Second, the Merge significantly reduces ETH issuance. This has been dubbed the \"triple halving\" in a nod to the Bitcoin halving, since the Merge reduces ETH issuance by 90%. With more than 14M ETH already staked, ETH could very well become deflationary after the transition. Furthermore, stakers are expected to earn between 8% and 12% APR at current projections. Staked ETH will not be withdrawable immediately after the Merge — it will only be enabled after the Shanghai upgrade, estimated to be 6 to 12 months later. Learn more about the common misconceptions of Ethereum post-Merge. The Merge will not increase transaction throughput or reduce gas fees, as the block production rate stays roughly the same at 12 seconds (currently 13 seconds). It will also not enable on-chain governance, with protocol changes still discussed and decided off-chain through stakeholders. Importantly, the transition to PoS is expected to reduce Ethereum\\'s annual energy consumption from 112 TWh/yr to only 0.01 TWh/yr — a 99.9% drop. This reduction prompted investors to expect an influx of institutional money in a \"greener\" Ethereum.

According to Tether, whenever it issues new USDT tokens, it allocates the same amount of USD to its reserves, thus ensuring that USDT is fully backed by cash and cash equivalents. The famously high volatility of the crypto markets means that cryptocurrencies can rise or fall by 10-20% within a single day, making them unreliable as a store of value. USDT, on the other hand, is protected from these fluctuations. This property makes USDT a safe haven for crypto investors - during periods of high volatility, they can park their portfolios in Tether without having to completely cash out into USD. In addition, USDT provides a simple way to transact a U.S. dollar equivalent between regions, countries and even continents via blockchain — without having to rely on a slow and expensive intermediary, like a bank or a financial services provider.

The big question is whether or not XRP is a security. On Dec. 22, 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs and two of its executives on the grounds that they traded $1.3 billion in their XRP token as security without registering it with the commission. There have been arguments for and against the lawsuit. However, Ripple has strongly countered the claims, arguing that the SEC has been biased in its assessment. The SEC uses the “Howey test,” based on the Supreme Court ruling on SEC v. W.J. Howey Co in 1946, to determine whether a cryptocurrency is a security. An asset is considered a security if it is sold with the expectation of getting profits from the efforts of other parties. Based on the commission’s definition of XRP in its lawsuit, the cryptocurrency would pass the Howey test, and according to SEC regulations, all securities must be registered. While most companies targeted by the SEC in a similar matter chose to settle, Ripple decided to fight. The outcome of the lawsuit will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications in the crypto space. If Ripple prevails, the SEC could lose some of its credibility, giving other crypto-based companies the confidence to revolt. On the flip side, if the SEC wins the case, it could upend the way crypto firms operate and usher in a new wave of registration rules that apply to securities.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What is BUSD?', 'completion': ' Binance USD (BUSD) is a 1:1 USD-backed stable coin issued by Binance (in partnership with Paxos), Approved and regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), The BUSD Monthly Audit Report can be viewed from the official website.

Cardano was founded back in 2017, and named after the 16th century Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano. The native ADA token takes its name from the 19th century mathematician Ada Lovelace, widely regarded as the world’s first computer programmer. The ADA token is designed to ensure that owners can participate in the operation of the network. Because of this, those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes to the software. The team behind the layered blockchain say that there have already been some compelling use cases for its technology, which aims to allow decentralized apps and smart contracts to be developed with modularity. In August 2021, Charles Hoskinson announced the launch of the Alonzo hard fork, causing Cardano price to surge, gaining 116% in the following month. On Sept. 12, 2021, the Cardano ‘Alonzo’ hard fork officially launched, bringing smart contract functionality to the blockchain. Over 100 smart contracts were deployed in the following 24 hours after the launch.

Its core component is Polygon SDK, a modular, flexible framework that supports building multiple types of applications. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Polygon Matic. Using Polygon, one can create optimistic rollup chains, ZK rollup chains, stand alone chains or any other kind of infra required by the developer. Polygon effectively transforms Ethereum into a full-fledged multi-chain system (aka Internet of Blockchains). This multi-chain system is akin to other ones such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche etc. with the advantages of Ethereum’s security, vibrant ecosystem and openness. The $MATIC token will continue to exist and will play an increasingly important role, securing the system and enabling governance. Polygon (formerly Matic Network) is a Layer 2 scaling solution backed by Binance and Coinbase. The project seeks to stimulate mass adoption of cryptocurrencies by resolving the problems of scalability on many blockchains. Polygon combines the Plasma Framework and the proof-of-stake blockchain architecture. The Plasma framework used by Polygon as proposed by the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, allows for the easy execution of scalable and autonomous smart contracts. Nothing will change for the existing ecosystem built on the Plasma-POS chain. With Polygon, new features are being built around the existing proven technology to expand the ability to cater to diverse needs from the developer ecosystem. Polygon will continue to develop the core technology so that it can scale to a larger ecosystem. Polygon boasts of up to 65,000 transactions per second on a single side chain, along with a respectable block confirmation time of less than two seconds. The framework also allows for the creation of globally available decentralized financial applications on a single foundational blockchain. The Plasma framework gives Polygon the potential of housing an unlimited number of decentralized applications on their infrastructure without experiencing the normal drawbacks common on proof-of-work blockchains. So far, Polygon has attracted more than 50 DApps to its PoS-secured Ethereum sidechain. MATIC, the native tokens of Polygon, is an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum blockchain. The tokens are used for payment services on Polygon and as a settlement currency between users who operate within the Polygon ecosystem.

Polkadot was designed to provide a foundation for a decentralized internet of blockchains, also known as Web3. Polkadot is known as a layer-0 metaprotocol because it underlies and describes a format for a network of layer 1 blockchains known as parachains (parallel chains). As a metaprotocol, Polkadot is also capable of autonomously and forklessly updating its own codebase via on-chain governance according to the will of its token holder community.

The team argued that the current governance system has elements of centralization. For example, the Polkadot Council, a body of executives, had sole control over some decision-making processes, including how the network\\'s treasury is spent. To this end, the new development is replacing the existing governance infrastructure with a framework in the form of a \"referendum.\" In other words, the planned upgrade will introduce a voting system allowing anyone to submit proposals and have them approved. Called Governorship version 2 or Gov2, this upgrade allegedly eliminates all forms of preferential first-class citizenry like the Technical Committee and the Polkadot Council. With this, the protocol aims to reduce the concentration of voting power by replacing the Technical Committee with the Polkadot Fellowship, designed to accommodate up to tens of thousands of members and feature a lower barrier for entry. The members are ranked to showcase the degree the protocol expects each participant to make informed decisions and support proposals that are in the best interest of the network. Another core component of the upgrade is the Origins and Tracks system. This mechanism will help grade the importance of a proposal and determine the appropriate way to treat them. As such, the network can implement suitable safeguards to ensure that the decision-making process is decentralized and fair. For instance, proposals tagged as Root Origins are the most sensitive. Such proposals undergo longer and more scrutinized consideration periods, with a higher approval threshold. Also, the system ensures that only one hypersensitive proposal can be deliberated on at a time. On the other hand, proposals with less sensitive Origins have shorter consideration periods with a lower approval threshold. Put simply, the grade of the importance of proposals will determine the type of safeguards assigned to them and the length of the decision-making process they undergo. Gov2 will first be tested on Kusama, an experimental development environment for testing applications, before it goes live on Polkadot. Once the testing and audit phase is complete, the team will submit the proposal to launch Gov2 on the Polkadot network.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Is SHIBA INU (SHIB)?', 'completion': ' Once upon a time, there was a very special dog.

Some effects of the upgrade became rather apparent when several South Korean exchanges started delisting Litecoin from their platforms shortly after the MWEB upgrade went into effect. Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit and Gopax have delisted LTC over the MimbleWimble upgrade, due to how it makes it impossible for these companies to adhere to the Act on the Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information. Per South Korean regulation, crypto exchanges need to mitigate money laundering and illicit activities at all costs. That means removing any currencies that provide users with additional privacy or anonymity.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Is TRON (TRX)?', 'completion': ' TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain-based operating system developed by the Tron Foundation and launched in 2017. Originally TRX tokens were ERC-20-based tokens deployed on Ethereum, but a year later they were moved to their own network. Initially, the project was created with the aim of providing full ownership rights to makers of digital content. The main goal is to help content creators (who receive only a small part of the income) and encourage them with more rewards for their work. invite content consumers to reward content makers directly (without intermediaries like YouTube, Facebook or Apple). The TRON software supports smart contracts, various kinds of blockchain systems, and decentralized applications aka dApps. The cryptocurrency platform uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin (BTC), namely UTXO. Transactions take place in a public ledger, where users can track the history of operations. Therefore, the platform was built to create a decentralized Internet and serves as a tool for developers to create dApps, acting as an alternative to Ethereum. Anyone can create dApps on the TRON network, offer content, and in return receive digital assets as compensation for their efforts. The ability to create content and share it openly without hesitation regarding transaction fees is an undeniable advantage of TRON. Network principles - The data hosted on the TRON network is free with no central authority. Content creators receive TRX tokens - a reward for their intellectual labour; TRON supports the creation of coins by content makers, which can be used in their own developed applications; TRON also carries out decentralized games on the network, players can encourage and reward creators with digital assets directly.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Who Are the Founders of TRON?', 'completion': ' TRON was founded by Justin Sun, who now serves as CEO. Educated at Peking University and the University of Pennsylvania, he was recognized by Forbes Asia in its 30 Under 30 series for entrepreneurs. Born in 1990, he was also associated with Ripple in the past — serving as its chief representative in the Greater China area.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What crypto Does Justin Sun own?', 'completion': ' Sun is the founder of a blockchain network called TRON and an advisor to the crypto exchange Huobi, which last week announced plans to lay off about 20% of its staff.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Justin Sun', 'completion': ' Justin Sun (Chinese - 孙宇晨; pinyi - Sūn Yǔchén; born July 30, 1990) is a Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur, and business executive. He is the founder of Tron (founded July 2017), a blockchain DAO ecosystem. Sun is the Permanent Representative of Grenada to the WTO. Sun was born in 1990.[1] He holds a B.A. in History from Peking University[2] and an M.A. in East Asia Studies from the University of Pennsylvania.[3]\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Is Avalanche (AVAX)?', 'completion': ' Avalanche is a layer one blockchain that functions as a platform for decentralized applications and custom blockchain networks. It is one of Ethereum’s rivals, aiming to unseat Ethereum as the most popular blockchain for smart contracts. It aims to do so by having a higher transaction output of up to 6,500 transactions per second while not compromising scalability. This is made possible by Avalanche’s unique architecture. The Avalanche network consists of three individual blockchains - the X-Chain, C-Chain and P-Chain. Each chain has a distinct purpose, which is radically different from the approach Bitcoin and Ethereum use, namely having all nodes validate all transactions. Avalanche blockchains even use different consensus mechanisms based on their use cases. After its mainnet launch in 2020, Avalanche has worked on developing its own ecosystem of DApps and DeFi. Different Ethereum-based projects such as SushiSwap and TrueUSD have integrated with Avalanche. Furthermore, the platform is constantly working on improving interoperability between its own ecosystem and Ethereum, like through the development of bridges.\\n'}]\n"
