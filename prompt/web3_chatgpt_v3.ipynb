U.S. The IRS issued guidance on the treatment of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in their March 2014-21 Notice [3]. The notice clarified the position that the IRS treats digital currencies as capital assets and are therefore subject to capital gains taxes. Any disposition of these digital currencies, including trading and spending, is a tax event and capital gains must be calculated in USD. When spending, the fair value should be used as the proceeds value. The IRS also clarified that mining is treated as immediate income at the fair or market value of those mined coins on their date of receipt. While the IRS Notice does confirm that Bitcoin is taxed as property rather than a currency, there are still some unresolved issues. For instance, how should a mined alt-coin income value be determined is there is no direct fiat market, and do alt-coins benefit from Like-Kind Exchanges [4]. There is a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) filing requirement for financial accounts in a foreign country when the aggregate value of the accounts exceeded $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. While the value of Bitcoins themselves don't count towards the FBAR threshold[5], there is the possibility that requirement applies to cash held in non-US bitcoin exchanges or wallet services[6]. An additional topic that may have a connection to Bitcoin is the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) filing requirement in the U.S.[7]. The Cryptocurrency Legal Advocacy Group (CLAG) has published memorandum detailing aspects of income taxation in the U.S. regarding Bitcoin[8].\"],\n",

       "  'Income that is earned through the exchange of services with another person, whether in the form of bitcoins, dollars, or barter; is included in gross income, and would be subject to income tax at applicable rates. Also these bitcoins could be subject to self employment tax. In some jurisdictions, income earned through the process of buying and selling bitcoins would also be included in gross income, but would be treated as capital gains. Note: The above interpretation is based on the assumption bitcoins are treated as a store of value such as gold, or other such commodity. If instead they are treated as a currency or debt, the full gain could be taxed based on market value at the end of each tax year. 3858 IRS Ends Currency ETN Advantage Simply put, the IRS never considers currency a long-term investment. Consequently, if bitcoins are treated as a currency, you will be taxed the same as holding an account in any non-functional (foreign) currency. Question: How are Bitcoins that I have mined treated for tax purposes? Answer: This is a tricky question, in that bitcoins are really the first digital currency that was created in this manner and actually have a significant value in relation to other currencies. Essentially it is somewhat uncharted territory. Literally bitcoins, and even digital currencies are so new, that there is little to no precedent for some aspects of bitcoin mining, from a tax perspective. Since Bitcoins are currently traded in various online marketplaces, when someone receives a Bitcoin, they can reasonably calculate it’s value in the local currency. Because of this, it is possible that the taxing authority will treat the receipt of a Bitcoin through a mining pool, or from an individual mining operation, as a taxable event. At that time, the taxpayer would be required to estimate the value of the Bitcoins in dollars and record that amount. This would have to be done either daily or weekly depending on the value of the Bitcoins if their value keeps fluctuating as much as it has the past few weeks. These amounts would be recorded as revenue from bitcoin mining operations and would be taxable less allowed expenses. When selling mined Bitcoins, however, you would also be taxed on the increase between the value you recorded them at when you first received them, and the value you sold them for. Another possibility is that the government will consider mined Bitcoins ‘intangible personal property’. As a rule, however, financial instruments are excluded from this particular category. The question is, are bitcoins a financial instrument, or rather, will the taxing authority consider them a financial instrument? We will have to wait and see if bitcoins become popular enough for a position to be taken on that.'],\n",

That means, if you mow your neighbor’s lawn, it doesn’t matter if he pays you $20 in cash, or $20 worth of bitcoins.

When using Bitcoin for payment the taxing authorities may be less likely to be aware of the payments but try to mow 10,000 neighbor’s lawns and not report the income and you will be much more likely to get caught.'],\n",
       " ['WHAT IS CRYPTO MINING?',\n",
       "  'Most people think of crypto mining simply as a way of creating new coins. Crypto mining, however, also involves validating cryptocurrency transactions on a blockchain network and adding them to a distributed ledger.  Most importantly, crypto mining prevents the double-spending of digital currency on a distributed network. Like physical currencies, when one member spends cryptocurrency, the digital ledger must be updated by debiting one account and crediting the other. However, the challenge of a digital currency is that digital platforms are easily manipulated. Bitcoin’s distributed ledger, therefore, only allows verified miners to update transactions on the digital ledger. This gives miners the extra responsibility of securing the network from double-spending. Meanwhile, new coins are generated to reward miners for their work in securing the network. Since distributed ledgers lack a centralized authority, the mining process is crucial for validating transactions. Miners are, therefore, incentivized to secure the network by participating in the transaction validation process that increases their chances of winning newly minted coins. In order to ensure that only verified crypto miners can mine and validate transactions, a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol has been put into place. PoW also secures the network from any external attacks.'],\n",
       " ['What is PROOF-OF-WORK?',\n",
       "  'Crypto mining is somewhat similar to mining precious metals. While miners of precious metals will unearth gold, silver, or diamonds, crypto miners will trigger the release of new coins into circulation. For miners to be rewarded with new coins, they need to deploy machines that solve complex mathematical equations in the form of cryptographic hashes. A hash is a truncated digital signature of a chunk of data. Hashes are generated to secure data transferred on a public network. Miners compete with their peers to zero in on a hash value generated by a crypto coin transaction, and the first miner to crack the code gets to add the block to the ledger and receive the reward. Each block uses a hash function to refer to the previous block, forming an unbroken chain of blocks that leads back to the first block. For this reason, peers on the network can easily verify whether certain blocks are valid and whether the miners who validated each block properly solved the hash to receive the reward. Over time, as miners deploy more advanced machines to solve PoW, the difficulty of equations on the network increases. At the same time, competition among miners rises, increasing the scarcity of cryptocurrency as a result.'],\n",
       " ['HOW TO START MINING CRYPTOCURRENCIES?',\n",
       "  'Mining cryptocurrencies requires computers with special software specifically designed to solve complicated, cryptographic mathematic equations. In the technology’s early days, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could be mined with a simple CPU chip on a home computer. Over the years, however, CPU chips have become impractical for mining most cryptocurrencies due to the increasing difficulty levels. Today, mining cryptocurrencies requires a specialized GPU or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miner. In addition, the GPUs in the mining rig must be connected to a reliable internet connection at all times. Each crypto miner is also required to be a member of an online crypto mining pool as well.'],\n",
       " ['DIFFERENT METHODS OF MINING CRYPTOCURRENCIES',\n",
       "  'Different methods of mining cryptocurrencies require different amounts of time. In the technology’s early days, for example, CPU mining was the go-to option for most miners. However, many find CPU mining to be too slow and impractical today because it takes months to accrue even a small amount of profit, given the high electrical and cooling costs and increased difficulty across the board. GPU mining is another method of mining cryptocurrencies. It maximizes computational power by bringing together a set of GPUs under one mining rig. For GPU mining, a motherboard and cooling system is required for the rig. Similarly, ASIC mining is yet another method of mining cryptocurrencies. Unlike GPU miners, ASIC miners are specifically designed to mine cryptocurrencies, so they produce more cryptocurrency units than GPUs. However, they are expensive, meaning that, as mining difficulty increases, they quickly become obsolete. Given the ever-increasing costs of GPU  and ASIC mining, cloud mining is becoming increasingly popular. Cloud mining allows individual miners to leverage the power of major corporations and dedicated crypto-mining facilities. Individual crypto miners can identify both free and paid cloud mining hosts online and rent a mining rig for a specific amount of time. This method is the most hands-free way to mine cryptocurrencies.'],\n",

If a mining pool succeeds, the reward is distributed across the mining pool, in proportion to the amount of resources that each miner contributed to the pool. Most crypto mining applications come with a mining pool; however, crypto enthusiasts now also join together online to create their own mining pools. Because some pools earn more rewards than others, miners are free to change pools whenever they need to. Miners consider official crypto mining pools more reliable since they receive frequent upgrades by their host companies, as well as regular technical support. The best place to find mining pools is CryptoCompare, where miners can compare different mining pools based on their reliability, profitability, and the coin that they want to mine.'],\n",
       " ['IS CRYPTO MINING WORTH IT?',\n",
       "  'Determining whether crypto mining is worthwhile depends on several factors. Whether a prospective miner chooses a CPU, GPU, ASIC miner, or cloud mining, the most important factors to consider are the mining rig’s hash rate, electric power consumption, and overall costs. Generally, crypto-mining machines consume a considerable amount of electricity and emit significant heat. For instance, the average ASIC miner will use about 72 terawatts of power to create a bitcoin in about ten minutes. These figures continue to change as technology advances and mining difficulty increases. Even though the price of the machine matters, it is just as important to consider electricity consumption, electricity costs in the area, and cooling costs, especially with GPU and ASIC mining rigs. It is also important to consider the level of difficulty for the cryptocurrency that an individual wants to mine, in order to determine whether the operation would even be profitable.'],\n",

With respect to (1), the IRS has issued Notice 2014-21 which directly addresses the tax implications of crypto mining. Under the Notice, a miner will recognize gross income upon receipt of the reward tokens in an amount equal to the fair market value of the coins at the time of receipt. Additionally, if a taxpayer’s mining activities constitute a trade or business or the taxpayer undertakes such activities as an independent contractor, the reward tokens/virtual currency payments are deemed to be self-employment income and accordingly, subject to self-employment taxes.

Bitcoin mining refers to ensuring that transactions are valid and added to the Bitcoin blockchain correctly using a global network of computers running the Bitcoin code. The process of mining is also the means by which new Bitcoins are created. The process of bitcoin mining involves the verification of new transactions against the Bitcoin network, which results in the production of new bitcoins. Bitcoin mining is the process by which Bitcoin transactions are validated digitally on the Bitcoin network and added to the blockchain ledger. It is done by solving complex cryptographic hash puzzles to verify blocks of transactions that are updated on the decentralized blockchain ledger. Solving these puzzles requires powerful computing power and sophisticated equipment. In return, miners are rewarded with Bitcoin, which is then released into circulation hence the name Bitcoin mining.

Plus, all the information is available on a public ledger, so anyone can view the transactions. Bitcoin Advantages What Is Blockchain? As mentioned, blockchain is the underlying technology of bitcoin. Blockchain is a public distributed ledger in which transactions are recorded in chronological order. Any record or transaction added to the blockchain cannot be modified or altered, meaning transactions are safe from hacking. A block is the smallest unit of a blockchain, and it is a container that holds all the transaction details. A block has four fields, or primary attributes: Previous hash: This attribute stores the value of the hash of the previous block, and that\\'s how the blocks are linked to one another. Data: This is the aggregated set of transactions included in this block—the set of transactions that were mined and validated and included in the block. Nonce: In a “proof of work” consensus algorithm, which bitcoin uses, the nonce is a random value used to vary the output of the hash value. Every block is supposed to generate a hash value, and the nonce is the parameter that is used to generate that hash value. The proof of work is the process of transaction verification done in blockchain. Hash: This is the value obtained by passing the previous hash value, the data and the nonce through the SHA-256 algorithm; it is the digital signature of the block. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash algorithm that produces a unique 256-bit alphanumeric hash value for any given input, and that is the unique feature of this cryptographic algorithm: Whatever input you give, it will always produce a 256-bit hash.'],\n",

It is also the way the network confirms new transactions and is a critical component of the blockchain ledger\\'s maintenance and development. \"Mining\" is performed using sophisticated hardware that solves an extremely complex computational math problem. The first computer to find the solution to the problem receives the next block of bitcoins and the process begins again. Cryptocurrency mining is painstaking, costly, and only sporadically rewarding. Nonetheless, mining has a magnetic appeal for many investors who are interested in cryptocurrency because of the fact that miners receive rewards for their work with crypto tokens. This may be because entrepreneurial types see mining as pennies from heaven, like California gold prospectors in 1849. And if you are technologically inclined, why not do it? The bitcoin reward that miners receive is an incentive that motivates people to assist in the primary purpose of mining: to legitimize and monitor Bitcoin transactions, ensuring their validity. Because many users all over the world share these responsibilities, Bitcoin is a \"decentralized\" cryptocurrency, or one that does not rely on any central authority like a central bank or government to oversee its regulation.'],\n",

The list includes: Mihai Alisie Alisie, due to his previous partnership with Buterin and his expertise in economic cybernetics, was a member of the founding team of Ethereum. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland. He helped set up a legal framework for the pre-sale of Ether and later emerged as the vice president of the Ethereum Foundation. In 2015, Alisie set out to start his own Ethereum-based project, named Akasha. Anthony Di lorio Anthony Di lorio was one of the financial sponsors of the Ethereum startup. He then took a back seat after the team decided to opt for a non-profit business principle. Following his decision to opt for a passive role, Di lorio emerged as the chief digital officer of the Toronto Stock Exchange for a short while before founding Decentral, the company behind Jaxx digital wallet. Amir Chetrit Amir Chetrit had a working relationship with Buterin during his stint at Colored Coins. Buterin asked Chetrit to join the founding team in December 2013. However, at a co-founder meeting in June 2014, other team members and Ethereum developers questioned the lack of input from Chetrit. It was at this meeting that Chetrit agreed to step down active involvement with Ethereum development while retaining his position as a co-founder. Charles Hoskinson Charles Hoskinson emerged as the CEO of the Ethereum startup in December 2013 only for him to hit the exit button after the team decided to promote a non-profit architecture for the organization. This spurred Hoskinson to create his version of a programmable blockchain ecosystem called Cardano. The platform is currently considered one of the major rival blockchains to Ethereum’s throne. Gavin Wood Gavin Wood was one of the core contributors during Ethereum’s early stage of development. He earned the position of co-founder as a result of his programming contributions. He created the first Ethereum testnet and even published the project’s yellow paper — the technical specification of the original white paper published by Buterin. Wood also proposed the ecosystem’s native programming language, Solidity. These days, Wood is busy working on Web3 Foundation and its flagship product, Polkadot. Jeffrey Wilcke Like Wood, Wilcke became a co-founder solely because of his programming contributions. He was working on MasterCoin when he discovered Ethereum. He began writing Google Go’s version of the platform independently. He is currently focusing on his game development studio, Grid Games. Joseph Lubin Before joining the Ethereum team, Joseph Lubin had amassed a wealth of experience in various fields.

Since its inception, Ethereum has maintained its spot as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. But like every other blockchain network that exists, Ethereum is not perfect. Notable, the legacy blockchain is plagued with high gas fees and low throughput of between 15 to 30 transactions per second. Although plans are already on the way to solve these shortcomings through several upgrades, many competitors have capitalized on this delay to offer crypto users cheaper and faster transactions. The term “Ethereum Killer” emerged around 2016/2017 as substitute blockchains such as Cardano began to enter the crypto scene. In 2018, EOS made its debut as the next “Ethereum killer,” raising $4.1 billion from investors, the highest amount an ICO had ever generated. Since then, others like Tezos, Solana, Fantom, Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain have surfaced as possible Ethereum killers. Each of these blockchains employs a different consensus model to tackle Ethereum’s PoW-induced limitations. For instance, Solana uses proof-of-history (PoH) while Binance Smart Chain utilizes both proof-of-authority (PoA) and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS). However, none of these alternative blockchains have been able to unseat Ethereum as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ethereum is also currently the largest blockchain for NFT trading activities.'],\n",

In addition to the high cost of transactions, the leading altcoin also suffers from scalability issues. As already mentioned, there are plans to transition to a proof-of-stake algorithm in order to boost the platform’s scalability and add a number of new features. The development team has already begun the transition process to ETH 2.0, implementing some upgrades along the way, including the London hard fork. The London upgrade went live in August 2021. It included five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), namely EIP-3529, EIP-3198, EIP-3541, and most notably EIP-1559 and EIP-3554.

       "  'The EIP-1559 upgrade introduces a mechanism that changes the way gas fees are estimated on the Ethereum blockchain. Before the upgrade, users had to participate in an open auction for their transactions to be picked up by a miner. This process is known as a “first-price auction,” and as expected, the highest bidder wins. With EIP-1559, this process is handled by an automated bidding system, and there is a set “base fee” for transactions to be included in the next block. This fee varies based on how congested the network is. Furthermore, users who wish to speed up their transactions can pay a “priority fee” to a miner for faster inclusion. EIP-1559 also introduces a fee-burning mechanism. A part of every transaction fee (the base fee) is burned and removed out of circulation. This is intended to lower the circulating supply of Ether and potentially increase the value of the token over time. Interestingly, less than two months after the London upgrade was implemented, the network had burned over $1 billion worth of Ether.'],\n",

The current Ethereum chain will become the Beacon Chain and serve as a settlement layer for smart contract interactions on other chains. In late 2021, Ethereum's Arrow Glacier update was delayed to June 2022. Until then, Vitalik Buterin expects the road to the network's endgame to be shaped by optimistic rollups and Zk-rollups. In January 2022, the Ethereum Foundation announced the decision to remove the “Ethereum 2.0” terminology to “save all future users from navigating this confusing mental model.” It went on to explain that the previously-referred-to terms of “Ethereum 1.0” would be branded the “execution layer,” while “Ethereum 2.0” will be called the “consensus layer”. This is ultimately to provide a more accurate version of the Ethereum roadmap. In an update on the progress of the Merge, on April 13, 2022, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko tweeted an update on the progress of the Merge, stating that they are “definitely in the final chapter of PoW on Ethereum.” He also mentioned that users can expect it to occur a few months after June, although no exact date was provided.

The Merge implements several critical changes to Ethereum. First, it merges the existing PoW Ethereum mainnet with the Beacon Chain, a PoS chain. Together, the two chains will form the new proof-of-stake Ethereum, which will consist of a consensus layer and an execution layer. The consensus layer will synchronize the chain state across the network, while the execution layer handles transactions and block production. Second, the Merge significantly reduces ETH issuance. This has been dubbed the \"triple halving\" in a nod to the Bitcoin halving, since the Merge reduces ETH issuance by 90%. With more than 14M ETH already staked, ETH could very well become deflationary after the transition. Furthermore, stakers are expected to earn between 8% and 12% APR at current projections. Staked ETH will not be withdrawable immediately after the Merge — it will only be enabled after the Shanghai upgrade, estimated to be 6 to 12 months later. Learn more about the common misconceptions of Ethereum post-Merge. The Merge will not increase transaction throughput or reduce gas fees, as the block production rate stays roughly the same at 12 seconds (currently 13 seconds). It will also not enable on-chain governance, with protocol changes still discussed and decided off-chain through stakeholders. Importantly, the transition to PoS is expected to reduce Ethereum\\'s annual energy consumption from 112 TWh/yr to only 0.01 TWh/yr — a 99.9% drop. This reduction prompted investors to expect an influx of institutional money in a \"greener\" Ethereum.

According to Tether, whenever it issues new USDT tokens, it allocates the same amount of USD to its reserves, thus ensuring that USDT is fully backed by cash and cash equivalents. The famously high volatility of the crypto markets means that cryptocurrencies can rise or fall by 10-20% within a single day, making them unreliable as a store of value. USDT, on the other hand, is protected from these fluctuations. This property makes USDT a safe haven for crypto investors: during periods of high volatility, they can park their portfolios in Tether without having to completely cash out into USD. In addition, USDT provides a simple way to transact a U.S. dollar equivalent between regions, countries and even continents via blockchain — without having to rely on a slow and expensive intermediary, like a bank or a financial services provider. However, over the years, there have been a number of controversies regarding the validity of Tether’s claims about their USD reserves, at times disrupting USDT’s price, which went down as low as $0.88 at one point in its history.

Every unit of this cryptocurrency in circulation is backed up by $1 that is held in reserve, in a mix of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. The Centre consortium, which is behind this asset, says USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions. The stablecoin originally launched on a limited basis in September 2018. Put simply, USD Coin’s mantra is “digital money for the digital age” — and the stablecoin is designed for a world where cashless transactions are becoming more common. Several use cases have been unveiled for the USD Coin. As well as providing a safe haven for crypto traders in times of volatility, those behind the stablecoin say it can also allow businesses to accept payments in digital assets, and shake up an array of sectors including decentralized finance and gaming. Overall, the goal is to create an ecosystem where USDC is accepted by as many wallets, exchanges, service providers and dApps as possible.'],\n",

Other crypto ventures are open to join this consortium. Explaining the rationale behind USDC, Circle co-founders Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville wrote: “We believe that an open internet of value exchange can transform and integrate the world more deeply, eventually eliminating artificial economic borders and enabling a more efficient and inclusive global marketplace that connects every person on the planet.” In 2020, Circle and Coinbase collectively announced a major upgrade to USDC’s protocol and smart contract. The goal of these enhancements is to make it easier for USD Coin to be used for everyday payments, commerce and peer-to-peer transactions.'],\n",

       "  \"The stablecoin market has become exceedingly crowded over recent years — but USD Coin has aimed to stand head and shoulders over competitors in several ways. One of them concerns transparency — and giving users the assurance that they will be able to withdraw 1 USDC and receive $1 in return without any issues. To this end, it says a major accounting firm is tasked with verifying the levels of cash that are held in reserve, and ensuring this matches up with the number of tokens in circulation. Unlike some crypto ventures, Circle and Coinbase have also achieved regulatory compliance — and this has helped pave the way for international expansion. Both projects are also well-funded, giving the stablecoin certainty. Coinbase briefly contemplated diversifying the funds backing USDC, but retracted that proposal after heavy community backlash. The transparency over the provenance of its funds has been a big reason for USDC's success. Unlike its rival USDT, which has found itself embroiled in repeated investigations, USDC has never been accused of any wrongdoing. That has led to USDC gobbling up much of USDT's dominance in the stablecoin market: although USDT commanded a 74%:16% lead in market share in February 2021, this has shrunk to a 45%:30% lead in February 2022.\"],\n",

The big question is whether or not XRP is a security. On Dec. 22, 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs and two of its executives on the grounds that they traded $1.3 billion in their XRP token as security without registering it with the commission. There have been arguments for and against the lawsuit. However, Ripple has strongly countered the claims, arguing that the SEC has been biased in its assessment. The SEC uses the “Howey test,” based on the Supreme Court ruling on SEC v. W.J. Howey Co in 1946, to determine whether a cryptocurrency is a security. An asset is considered a security if it is sold with the expectation of getting profits from the efforts of other parties. Based on the commission’s definition of XRP in its lawsuit, the cryptocurrency would pass the Howey test, and according to SEC regulations, all securities must be registered. While most companies targeted by the SEC in a similar matter chose to settle, Ripple decided to fight. The outcome of the lawsuit will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications in the crypto space. If Ripple prevails, the SEC could lose some of its credibility, giving other crypto-based companies the confidence to revolt. On the flip side, if the SEC wins the case, it could upend the way crypto firms operate and usher in a new wave of registration rules that apply to securities.'],\n",

Polygon (formerly Matic Network) is a Layer 2 scaling solution backed by Binance and Coinbase. The project seeks to stimulate mass adoption of cryptocurrencies by resolving the problems of scalability on many blockchains. Polygon combines the Plasma Framework and the proof-of-stake blockchain architecture. The Plasma framework used by Polygon as proposed by the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, allows for the easy execution of scalable and autonomous smart contracts. Nothing will change for the existing ecosystem built on the Plasma-POS chain. With Polygon, new features are being built around the existing proven technology to expand the ability to cater to diverse needs from the developer ecosystem. Polygon will continue to develop the core technology so that it can scale to a larger ecosystem. Polygon boasts of up to 65,000 transactions per second on a single side chain, along with a respectable block confirmation time of less than two seconds. The framework also allows for the creation of globally available decentralized financial applications on a single foundational blockchain. The Plasma framework gives Polygon the potential of housing an unlimited number of decentralized applications on their infrastructure without experiencing the normal drawbacks common on proof-of-work blockchains. So far, Polygon has attracted more than 50 DApps to its PoS-secured Ethereum sidechain. MATIC, the native tokens of Polygon, is an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum blockchain.

Polkadot was designed to provide a foundation for a decentralized internet of blockchains, also known as Web3. Polkadot is known as a layer-0 metaprotocol because it underlies and describes a format for a network of layer 1 blockchains known as parachains (parallel chains). As a metaprotocol, Polkadot is also capable of autonomously and forklessly updating its own codebase via on-chain governance according to the will of its token holder community. Polkadot provides a foundation to support a decentralized web, controlled by its users, and to simplify the creation of new applications, institutions and services. The Polkadot protocol can connect public and private chains, permissionless networks, oracles and future technologies, allowing these independent blockchains to trustlessly share information and transactions through the Polkadot Relay Chain (explained further down). Polkadot’s native DOT token serves three clear purposes: staking for operations and security, facilitating network governance, and bonding tokens to connect parachains . Polkadot has four core components: Relay Chain: Polkadot’s “heart,” helping to create consensus, interoperability and shared security across the network of different chains; Parachains: independent chains that can have their own tokens and be optimized for specific use cases; Parathreads: similar to parachains but with flexible connectivity based on an economical pay-as-you-go model; Bridges: allow parachains and parathreads to connect and communicate with external blockchains like Ethereum.'],\n",

       "  'Announced in June 2022, the protocol is set to overhaul the existing framework so that the network will become more entrenched in the decentralization ethos. The team argued that the current governance system has elements of centralization. For example, the Polkadot Council, a body of executives, had sole control over some decision-making processes, including how the network\\'s treasury is spent. To this end, the new development is replacing the existing governance infrastructure with a framework in the form of a \"referendum.\" In other words, the planned upgrade will introduce a voting system allowing anyone to submit proposals and have them approved. Called Governorship version 2 or Gov2, this upgrade allegedly eliminates all forms of preferential first-class citizenry like the Technical Committee and the Polkadot Council. With this, the protocol aims to reduce the concentration of voting power by replacing the Technical Committee with the Polkadot Fellowship, designed to accommodate up to tens of thousands of members and feature a lower barrier for entry. The members are ranked to showcase the degree the protocol expects each participant to make informed decisions and support proposals that are in the best interest of the network. Another core component of the upgrade is the Origins and Tracks system. This mechanism will help grade the importance of a proposal and determine the appropriate way to treat them. As such, the network can implement suitable safeguards to ensure that the decision-making process is decentralized and fair. For instance, proposals tagged as Root Origins are the most sensitive. Such proposals undergo longer and more scrutinized consideration periods, with a higher approval threshold. Also, the system ensures that only one hypersensitive proposal can be deliberated on at a time. On the other hand, proposals with less sensitive Origins have shorter consideration periods with a lower approval threshold. Put simply, the grade of the importance of proposals will determine the type of safeguards assigned to them and the length of the decision-making process they undergo. Gov2 will first be tested on Kusama, an experimental development environment for testing applications, before it goes live on Polkadot. Once the testing and audit phase is complete, the team will submit the proposal to launch Gov2 on the Polkadot network.'],\n",

That dog was a Shiba Inu, and this dog inspired millions of people around the world to invest money into tokens with the dog\\'s image on it. According to the SHIBA INU website, SHIB is the \"DOGECOIN KILLER\" and is listed on their own ShibaSwap, a DEX. Shiba Inu coin was created anonymously in August 2020 under the pseudonym \"Ryoshi.\" Ryoshi says about himself that he is a nobody and not important and that the efforts to unmask his identity, even if successful, would be underwhelming. This meme coin quickly gained speed and value as a community of investors was drawn in by the cute charm of the coin paired with headlines and tweets from personalities like Elon Musk and Vitalik Buterin. Vitalik Buterin was long believed to be the originator of Shiba Inu, but denied such rumors on the Lex Fridman podcast on June 5, 2021. Shiba Inu aims to be the Ethereum-based counterpart to Dogecoin\\'s Srypt-based mining algorithm. Shiba Inu and the SHIB token are part of a swarm of dog-themed cryptocurrencies, including Baby Dogecoin (BabyDoge), Dogecoin (DOGE), JINDO INU (JIND), Alaska Inu (LAS) and Alaskan Malamute Token (LASM). These lesser-valued tokens have attracted investors who missed the Dogecoin pump from 0.0002 to nearly 0.75 USD. Shiba\\'s success sparked an avalanche of copycats, such as BitShiba, Shiba Fantom, Shibalana, King Shiba, SHIBAVAX, Captain Shibarrow, SHIBA2K22, SpookyShiba and countless others. In total, there may be well over 100 Shiba Inu copies, and the number keeps rising constantly. On Sept. 17, 2021, Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange, listed Shiba Inu on their platform. This news caused Shiba Inu price to rise by over 40% in the following two days, bringing the meme dog token into the spotlight again. Shiba Inu has since attracted more interest from other exchanges as well. Bitso, Mexico\\'s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, announced in September that SHIB would start trading on its exchange. Giottus, an Indian crypto exchange, announced the same. Bitstamp, the biggest crypto exchange in Europe, said that it would list Shiba Inu for trading at the beginning of 2022.

In his blog RYOSHI RESEARCH, he characterizes himself as \"just some guy of no consequence tapping at a keyboard.\" Ryoshi said that usually in projects there are different roles like a CEO, a \"tech guy,\" and a roadmap, resulting in \"someone plebs can bitch at.\" He stresses that with Shiba, no one person is accountable or responsible and underlines that he owns 0 SHIB to this day. For this reason, Ryoshi can be \"pure and unbiased,\" getting satisfaction from Shiba \"in other ways.\" It has been speculated that Vitalik Buterin was behind the initial liquidity that helped set up Shiba Inu\\'s liquidity on Uniswap. According to Ryoshi, he had \"a fren\" he met at Devcon in Osaka that sent him 10 ETH to set up the liquidity pair on Uniswap. Ryoshi also stated that Shiba Inu was an experiment in decentralized community building, and he thus declined all the influencer requests and pitches from different exchanges he received.

The MimbleWimble upgrade was first proposed in November 2019 through a Litecoin Improvement Proposal. At the time, the Litecoin developers aimed to further focus on improving anonymity between senders and receivers. Following the MimbleWimble upgrade at Litecoin block 2,257,920, users could opt for moe transaction privacy and explore other benefits, including blocks containing less needless transaction data. More specifically, long transactions are broken down into a single transfer by recording one input-output pair. The MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB) upgrade was successfully activated on May 19, 2022. However, the upgrade puts Litecoin in the crosshairs of regulators who do not take kindly to privacy-capable cryptocurrencies. Some effects of the upgrade became rather apparent when several South Korean exchanges started delisting Litecoin from their platforms shortly after the MWEB upgrade went into effect. Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit and Gopax have delisted LTC over the MimbleWimble upgrade, due to how it makes it impossible for these companies to adhere to the Act on the Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information. Per South Korean regulation, crypto exchanges need to mitigate money laundering and illicit activities at all costs.

Originally TRX tokens were ERC-20-based tokens deployed on Ethereum, but a year later they were moved to their own network. Initially, the project was created with the aim of providing full ownership rights to makers of digital content. The main goal is to help content creators (who receive only a small part of the income) and encourage them with more rewards for their work. How: invite content consumers to reward content makers directly (without intermediaries like YouTube, Facebook or Apple). The TRON software supports smart contracts, various kinds of blockchain systems, and decentralized applications aka dApps. The cryptocurrency platform uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin (BTC), namely UTXO. Transactions take place in a public ledger, where users can track the history of operations. Therefore, the platform was built to create a decentralized Internet and serves as a tool for developers to create dApps, acting as an alternative to Ethereum. Anyone can create dApps on the TRON network, offer content, and in return receive digital assets as compensation for their efforts. The ability to create content and share it openly without hesitation regarding transaction fees is an undeniable advantage of TRON. Network principles: The data hosted on the TRON network is free with no central authority. Content creators receive TRX tokens - a reward for their intellectual labour; TRON supports the creation of coins by content makers, which can be used in their own developed applications; TRON also carries out decentralized games on the network, players can encourage and reward creators with digital assets directly.'],\n",

Consider how you might prove a claim (e.g., “I am a citizen of X country”) to another party (e.g., a service provider). You’d need to provide “evidence” to back up your claim, such as a national passport or driver’s license. But there are problems with this approach, chiefly the lack of privacy. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) shared with third-party services is stored in central databases, which are vulnerable to hacks. With identity theft becoming a critical issue, there are calls for more privacy-protecting means of sharing sensitive information. Zero-knowledge proofs solve this problem by eliminating the need to reveal information to prove validity of claims. The zero-knowledge protocol uses the statement (called a ‘witness’) as input to generate a succinct proof of its validity. This proof provides strong guarantees that a statement is true without exposing the information used in creating it. Going back to our earlier example, the only evidence you need to prove your citizenship claim is a zero-knowledge proof. The verifier only has to check if certain properties of the proof hold true to be convinced that the underlying statement holds true as well.'],\n",
       " ['How do zero-knowledge proofs work?',\n",
       "  \"A zero-knowledge proof allows you to prove the truth of a statement without sharing the statement’s contents or revealing how you discovered the truth. To make this possible, zero-knowledge protocols rely on algorithms that take some data as input and return ‘true’ or ‘false’ as output. A zero-knowledge protocol must satisfy the following criteria: Completeness: If the input is valid, the zero-knowledge protocol always returns ‘true’. Hence, if the underlying statement is true, and the prover and verifier act honestly, the proof can be accepted. Soundness: If the input is invalid, it is theoretically impossible to fool the zero-knowledge protocol to return ‘true’. Hence, a lying prover cannot trick an honest verifier into believing an invalid statement is valid (except with a tiny margin of probability). Zero-knowledge: The verifier learns nothing about a statement beyond its validity or falsity (they have “zero knowledge” of the statement). This requirement also prevents the verifier from deriving the original input (the statement’s contents) from the proof. In basic form, a zero-knowledge proof is made up of three elements: witness, challenge, and response. Witness: With a zero-knowledge proof, the prover wants to prove knowledge of some hidden information. The secret information is the “witness” to the proof, and the prover's assumed knowledge of the witness establishes a set of questions that can only be answered by a party with knowledge of the information. Thus, the prover starts the proving process by randomly choosing a question, calculating the answer, and sending it to the verifier. Challenge: The verifier randomly picks another question from the set and asks the prover to answer it. Response: The prover accepts the question, calculates the answer, and returns it to the verifier. The prover’s response allows the verifier to check if the former really has access to the witness. To ensure the prover isn’t guessing blindly and getting the correct answers by chance, the verifier picks more questions to ask. By repeating this interaction many times, the possibility of the prover faking knowledge of the witness drops significantly until the verifier is satisfied. The above describes the structure of an ‘interactive zero-knowledge proof’. Early zero-knowledge protocols used interactive proving, where verifying the validity of a statement required back-and-forth communication between provers and verifiers.\"],\n",

DeFi is distinct because it expands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex financial use cases.'],\n",

       "  'NFTs are unique, irreplaceable crypto assets on the blockchain. These one-of-a-kind assets are typically created using a guideline, also known as a token standard, that ensures that each NFT has a unique token ID. Apart from crypto collectibles and NFT art, static NFTs can digitize real-world assets like passports, certificates, and real estate deeds. However, these experimental use cases of NFTs — while already a reality — may be unable to fully represent real-world assets that carry non-static information. When smart contracts create static NFTs, these assets are minted with permanent, immutable token data — in other words, this data cannot be altered. Therefore, regardless of external circumstances, static NFTs remain unchanged and as such, become outdated in the event of information change. Dynamic NFTs, however, can address this limitation. While the token IDs of these NFTs stay the same, dynamic NFTs have the unique ability to change under certain conditions.'],\n",

       "  'The term \"metaverse\" was first coined in the early ’90s in the sci-fi world. In the years since, the concept of a metaverse has evolved due to recent technological innovations. It has also gained increasing attention as a potential digital platform for both social and economic activity. The rise of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency has also played an important role in the development of the metaverse. Many projects have already explored it, using these technologies to create decentralized and immersive virtual worlds. This article will provide a brief history of the metaverse and explore crypto\\'s role in its evolution. The metaverse is still not entirely defined. However, the general idea is that it is a virtual space connecting our digital and real-world lives. Some call it the next evolution of the Internet that will make online experiences interactive and immersive. Defining the metaverse is difficult as it encompasses much more than just a single product, service, or project. Instead, it combines different technologies, such as the Internet, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), 3D reconstruction, and the Internet of Things (IoT). In science fiction where the term “metaverse” originated, it’s portrayed as a highly immersive and interactive virtual world. Today, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are taking actionable steps to make this concept a reality. The Web3 movement has shown that the metaverse is not just confined to the sci-fi genre but is something that might already exist. Web3 has been forming an ecosystem that incentivizes developers to build metaverse-like decentralized applications (DApps), such as play-to-earn (P2E) games. Games like Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, and Decentraland already contain aspects of the metaverse, connecting elements of players\\' lives to online worlds.'],\n",

       " ['What Is a Crypto cross chain Bridge?',\n",
       "  \"A crypto bridge is a protocol that enables two or more blockchains to work and share data with each other. It connects blockchains so users on one network can participate in the activities of another. This allows crypto users to utilize their holdings outside native chains. Blockchains differ in their tokens, consensus mechanisms, communities, and governance models. A crypto bridge facilitates blockchain interoperability, allowing data and crypto asset transfers across different chains. Crypto bridges also allow blockchains to build off one another’s strengths. For example, Bitcoin doesn't have to reconstruct its blockchain to incorporate smart contracts because other networks can fill that gap. Additionally, crypto bridges allow developers to communicate and collaborate regardless of which network they're working on. As such, protocols can more easily connect and build upon one another's features and use cases. Usually, crypto bridges port tokens from one network to another by wrapping them, a process whereby the bridge locks the original token in a smart contract and creates an equivalent amount of wrapped tokens, such as WETH for ETH or WBNB for BNB. There're also other technologies focusing on interoperability in the crypto ecosystem. One such example is Layer 0 protocols. Layer 0s allow other blockchains to build on top of them by offering the blockchains a common underlying layer. Therefore, a blockchain doesn't require bridges because each blockchain building on top of Layer 0 connects to other blockchains right from the start.\"],\n",

Now let’s move on to discuss the commonly asked question, “how does DeFi lending work”. DeFi lending, or decentralized finance lending, is quite similar to the traditional lending service offered by the banks, except that it is offered by the P2P decentralized applications (DApps). The DeFi lending platforms help people borrow and lend funds which allow the crypto holders to earn a substantial income. The DeFi lending process is simple. It focuses on offering crypto loans with a trustless approach. This means that the users can easily lock their crypto assets on the DeFi lending platform without worrying about intermediaries. The borrowers can directly opt for loans from the decentralized platform with the help of P2P lending. In addition to it, the DeFi lending protocol helps lenders to earn interest on crypto assets. As compared to the conventional loan processing system of the banks, DeFi lending enables individuals to become a lender just like a bank. An individual can easily lend their assets to others and accrue interest on that loan. Just like the loan offices in traditional banks, DeFi lending mainly relies on the lending pools where the users can add their assets to the lending pool and ensure quick distribution among borrowers through smart contracts.'],\n",

Below are specific details to individual tax jurisdictions. U.S. The IRS issued guidance on the treatment of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in their March 2014-21 Notice [3]. The notice clarified the position that the IRS treats digital currencies as capital assets and are therefore subject to capital gains taxes. Any disposition of these digital currencies, including trading and spending, is a tax event and capital gains must be calculated in USD. When spending, the fair value should be used as the proceeds value. The IRS also clarified that mining is treated as immediate income at the fair or market value of those mined coins on their date of receipt. While the IRS Notice does confirm that Bitcoin is taxed as property rather than a currency, there are still some unresolved issues. For instance, how should a mined alt-coin income value be determined is there is no direct fiat market, and do alt-coins benefit from Like-Kind Exchanges [4]. There is a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) filing requirement for financial accounts in a foreign country when the aggregate value of the accounts exceeded $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. While the value of Bitcoins themselves don't count towards the FBAR threshold[5], there is the possibility that requirement applies to cash held in non-US bitcoin exchanges or wallet services[6]. An additional topic that may have a connection to Bitcoin is the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) filing requirement in the U.S.[7]. The Cryptocurrency Legal Advocacy Group (CLAG) has published memorandum detailing aspects of income taxation in the U.S. regarding Bitcoin[8].\\n\"}, {'prompt': 'Do I need to register as a business/LLC/corporation to mine Bitcoins and deduct expenses?', 'completion': ' In most instances, there is no requirement to do so. Whether you decide to form a corporation, register as an LLC, or simply operate as a private individual (sole proprietorship), the basic concept of tax treatment for Bitcoins is going to remain the same. For example, you will report gross income, deduct expenses, and have a net taxable income on which you will be required to pay income tax, as well as possibly self employment tax depending on how your mining business is set up.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What expenses can I deduct/expense/itemize if I set up a Bitcoin mining operation?', 'completion': ' That depends on your situation. Generally speaking, though, you can deduct business expenses that are ordinary and necessary. Buying video cards would be both of these, buying a big screen TV to watch while mining would be neither.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Are my bitcoins taxed as income, or as capital gains?', 'completion': ' Income that is earned through the exchange of services with another person, whether in the form of bitcoins, dollars, or barter; is included in gross income, and would be subject to income tax at applicable rates. Also these bitcoins could be subject to self employment tax. In some jurisdictions, income earned through the process of buying and selling bitcoins would also be included in gross income, but would be treated as capital gains. Note: The above interpretation is based on the assumption bitcoins are treated as a store of value such as gold, or other such commodity. If instead they are treated as a currency or debt, the full gain could be taxed based on market value at the end of each tax year. 3858 IRS Ends Currency ETN Advantage Simply put, the IRS never considers currency a long-term investment. Consequently, if bitcoins are treated as a currency, you will be taxed the same as holding an account in any non-functional (foreign) currency. Question: How are Bitcoins that I have mined treated for tax purposes? Answer: This is a tricky question, in that bitcoins are really the first digital currency that was created in this manner and actually have a significant value in relation to other currencies. Essentially it is somewhat uncharted territory. Literally bitcoins, and even digital currencies are so new, that there is little to no precedent for some aspects of bitcoin mining, from a tax perspective. Since Bitcoins are currently traded in various online marketplaces, when someone receives a Bitcoin, they can reasonably calculate it’s value in the local currency. Because of this, it is possible that the taxing authority will treat the receipt of a Bitcoin through a mining pool, or from an individual mining operation, as a taxable event. At that time, the taxpayer would be required to estimate the value of the Bitcoins in dollars and record that amount. This would have to be done either daily or weekly depending on the value of the Bitcoins if their value keeps fluctuating as much as it has the past few weeks. These amounts would be recorded as revenue from bitcoin mining operations and would be taxable less allowed expenses. When selling mined Bitcoins, however, you would also be taxed on the increase between the value you recorded them at when you first received them, and the value you sold them for. Another possibility is that the government will consider mined Bitcoins ‘intangible personal property’. As a rule, however, financial instruments are excluded from this particular category. The question is, are bitcoins a financial instrument, or rather, will the taxing authority consider them a financial instrument? We will have to wait and see if bitcoins become popular enough for a position to be taken on that.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What is Bitcoin?', 'completion': ' Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Are bitcoins taxable if I earned them by doing a service for someone else, or received them in exchange for something?', 'completion': ' Anything that you receive as payment for goods or services is generally taxable income unless it is specifically exempted. That means, if you mow your neighbor’s lawn, it doesn’t matter if he pays you $20 in cash, or $20 worth of bitcoins. (Or $20 worth of tomatoes for that matter) In many jurisdictions, you are still legally required to report that as income. When using Bitcoin for payment the taxing authorities may be less likely to be aware of the payments but try to mow 10,000 neighbor’s lawns and not report the income and you will be much more likely to get caught.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'WHAT IS CRYPTO MINING?', 'completion': ' Most people think of crypto mining simply as a way of creating new coins. Crypto mining, however, also involves validating cryptocurrency transactions on a blockchain network and adding them to a distributed ledger.  Most importantly, crypto mining prevents the double-spending of digital currency on a distributed network. Like physical currencies, when one member spends cryptocurrency, the digital ledger must be updated by debiting one account and crediting the other. However, the challenge of a digital currency is that digital platforms are easily manipulated. Bitcoin’s distributed ledger, therefore, only allows verified miners to update transactions on the digital ledger. This gives miners the extra responsibility of securing the network from double-spending. Meanwhile, new coins are generated to reward miners for their work in securing the network. Since distributed ledgers lack a centralized authority, the mining process is crucial for validating transactions. Miners are, therefore, incentivized to secure the network by participating in the transaction validation process that increases their chances of winning newly minted coins. In order to ensure that only verified crypto miners can mine and validate transactions, a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol has been put into place. PoW also secures the network from any external attacks.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What is PROOF-OF-WORK?', 'completion': ' Crypto mining is somewhat similar to mining precious metals. While miners of precious metals will unearth gold, silver, or diamonds, crypto miners will trigger the release of new coins into circulation. For miners to be rewarded with new coins, they need to deploy machines that solve complex mathematical equations in the form of cryptographic hashes. A hash is a truncated digital signature of a chunk of data. Hashes are generated to secure data transferred on a public network. Miners compete with their peers to zero in on a hash value generated by a crypto coin transaction, and the first miner to crack the code gets to add the block to the ledger and receive the reward. Each block uses a hash function to refer to the previous block, forming an unbroken chain of blocks that leads back to the first block. For this reason, peers on the network can easily verify whether certain blocks are valid and whether the miners who validated each block properly solved the hash to receive the reward. Over time, as miners deploy more advanced machines to solve PoW, the difficulty of equations on the network increases. At the same time, competition among miners rises, increasing the scarcity of cryptocurrency as a result.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'HOW TO START MINING CRYPTOCURRENCIES?', 'completion': ' Mining cryptocurrencies requires computers with special software specifically designed to solve complicated, cryptographic mathematic equations. In the technology’s early days, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could be mined with a simple CPU chip on a home computer. Over the years, however, CPU chips have become impractical for mining most cryptocurrencies due to the increasing difficulty levels. Today, mining cryptocurrencies requires a specialized GPU or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miner. In addition, the GPUs in the mining rig must be connected to a reliable internet connection at all times. Each crypto miner is also required to be a member of an online crypto mining pool as well.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'DIFFERENT METHODS OF MINING CRYPTOCURRENCIES', 'completion': ' Different methods of mining cryptocurrencies require different amounts of time. In the technology’s early days, for example, CPU mining was the go-to option for most miners. However, many find CPU mining to be too slow and impractical today because it takes months to accrue even a small amount of profit, given the high electrical and cooling costs and increased difficulty across the board. GPU mining is another method of mining cryptocurrencies. It maximizes computational power by bringing together a set of GPUs under one mining rig. For GPU mining, a motherboard and cooling system is required for the rig. Similarly, ASIC mining is yet another method of mining cryptocurrencies. Unlike GPU miners, ASIC miners are specifically designed to mine cryptocurrencies, so they produce more cryptocurrency units than GPUs. However, they are expensive, meaning that, as mining difficulty increases, they quickly become obsolete. Given the ever-increasing costs of GPU  and ASIC mining, cloud mining is becoming increasingly popular. Cloud mining allows individual miners to leverage the power of major corporations and dedicated crypto-mining facilities. Individual crypto miners can identify both free and paid cloud mining hosts online and rent a mining rig for a specific amount of time. This method is the most hands-free way to mine cryptocurrencies.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'How to mine cyrptocurrencies more efficiently with MINING POOLS', 'completion': ' Mining pools allow miners to combine their computational resources in order to increase their chances of finding and mining blocks on a blockchain. If a mining pool succeeds, the reward is distributed across the mining pool, in proportion to the amount of resources that each miner contributed to the pool. Most crypto mining applications come with a mining pool; however, crypto enthusiasts now also join together online to create their own mining pools. Because some pools earn more rewards than others, miners are free to change pools whenever they need to. Miners consider official crypto mining pools more reliable since they receive frequent upgrades by their host companies, as well as regular technical support. The best place to find mining pools is CryptoCompare, where miners can compare different mining pools based on their reliability, profitability, and the coin that they want to mine.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'IS CRYPTO MINING WORTH IT?', 'completion': ' Determining whether crypto mining is worthwhile depends on several factors. Whether a prospective miner chooses a CPU, GPU, ASIC miner, or cloud mining, the most important factors to consider are the mining rig’s hash rate, electric power consumption, and overall costs. Generally, crypto-mining machines consume a considerable amount of electricity and emit significant heat. For instance, the average ASIC miner will use about 72 terawatts of power to create a bitcoin in about ten minutes. These figures continue to change as technology advances and mining difficulty increases. Even though the price of the machine matters, it is just as important to consider electricity consumption, electricity costs in the area, and cooling costs, especially with GPU and ASIC mining rigs. It is also important to consider the level of difficulty for the cryptocurrency that an individual wants to mine, in order to determine whether the operation would even be profitable.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'THE TAX IMPLICATIONS OF CRYPTO MINING', 'completion': ' The taxation of crypto mining remains an important consideration. Crypto miners will generally face tax consequences (1) when they are rewarded with cryptocurrency for performing mining activities, and (2) when they sell or exchange the reward tokens. With respect to (1), the IRS has issued Notice 2014-21 which directly addresses the tax implications of crypto mining. Under the Notice, a miner will recognize gross income upon receipt of the reward tokens in an amount equal to the fair market value of the coins at the time of receipt. Additionally, if a taxpayer’s mining activities constitute a trade or business or the taxpayer undertakes such activities as an independent contractor, the reward tokens/virtual currency payments are deemed to be self-employment income and accordingly, subject to self-employment taxes. Similarly, if a taxpayer performs mining activities as an employee, payments made in cryptocurrency are treated as wages subject to federal income tax withholding of Social Security/Medicare and unemployment taxes.

The future is promising for Bitcoin miners and enthusiasts, and it’s a potentially rewarding enterprise for anyone who wants to give it a go. However, let’s first take some time to learn the basics about Bitcoin mining. In brief The blockchain ledger keeps growing as transactions that have taken place in the network are constantly added to it. Transactions in the blockchain network are grouped into blocks that are linked together to form a chain of blocks, hence blockchain. Blockchain transactions are stored in chronological order marked by timestamps and hash functions. By this virtue, records stored in the blockchain network are permanent and immutable.

There are three ways through which bitcoin miners can acquire bitcoins. These are: Purchasing bitcoins on the exchange market Accepting bitcoin in exchange for goods and services Mining new bitcoins Of these three, bitcoin mining is perhaps the most exciting option as it sends miners on a path to discovery. There is a caveat. Bitcoin mining can be quite taxing as it requires very high computing power to solve complex mathematical equations to verify transactions and add them to the blockchain digital ledger. Simplilearn’s video tutorial explains the process of Bitcoin mining and the advantages of Bitcoin over traditional fiat currencies. What Is Bitcoin Mining? Bitcoin mining refers to ensuring that transactions are valid and added to the Bitcoin blockchain correctly using a global network of computers running the Bitcoin code. The process of mining is also the means by which new Bitcoins are created. The process of bitcoin mining involves the verification of new transactions against the Bitcoin network, which results in the production of new bitcoins. Bitcoin mining is the process by which Bitcoin transactions are validated digitally on the Bitcoin network and added to the blockchain ledger. It is done by solving complex cryptographic hash puzzles to verify blocks of transactions that are updated on the decentralized blockchain ledger. Solving these puzzles requires powerful computing power and sophisticated equipment. In return, miners are rewarded with Bitcoin, which is then released into circulation hence the name Bitcoin mining.

Plus, all the information is available on a public ledger, so anyone can view the transactions. Bitcoin Advantages What Is Blockchain? As mentioned, blockchain is the underlying technology of bitcoin. Blockchain is a public distributed ledger in which transactions are recorded in chronological order. Any record or transaction added to the blockchain cannot be modified or altered, meaning transactions are safe from hacking. A block is the smallest unit of a blockchain, and it is a container that holds all the transaction details. A block has four fields, or primary attributes: Previous hash: This attribute stores the value of the hash of the previous block, and that\\'s how the blocks are linked to one another. Data: This is the aggregated set of transactions included in this block—the set of transactions that were mined and validated and included in the block. Nonce: In a “proof of work” consensus algorithm, which bitcoin uses, the nonce is a random value used to vary the output of the hash value. Every block is supposed to generate a hash value, and the nonce is the parameter that is used to generate that hash value. The proof of work is the process of transaction verification done in blockchain. Hash: This is the value obtained by passing the previous hash value, the data and the nonce through the SHA-256 algorithm; it is the digital signature of the block. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash algorithm that produces a unique 256-bit alphanumeric hash value for any given input, and that is the unique feature of this cryptographic algorithm: Whatever input you give, it will always produce a 256-bit hash.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Public distributed ledger', 'completion': ' A distributed ledger is a record of all transactions maintained in the blockchain network across the globe.

It is also the way the network confirms new transactions and is a critical component of the blockchain ledger\\'s maintenance and development. \"Mining\" is performed using sophisticated hardware that solves an extremely complex computational math problem. The first computer to find the solution to the problem receives the next block of bitcoins and the process begins again. Cryptocurrency mining is painstaking, costly, and only sporadically rewarding. Nonetheless, mining has a magnetic appeal for many investors who are interested in cryptocurrency because of the fact that miners receive rewards for their work with crypto tokens. This may be because entrepreneurial types see mining as pennies from heaven, like California gold prospectors in 1849. And if you are technologically inclined, why not do it? The bitcoin reward that miners receive is an incentive that motivates people to assist in the primary purpose of mining: to legitimize and monitor Bitcoin transactions, ensuring their validity. Because many users all over the world share these responsibilities, Bitcoin is a \"decentralized\" cryptocurrency, or one that does not rely on any central authority like a central bank or government to oversee its regulation.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Is Ethereum (ETH)?', 'completion': ' Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts. Ethereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014. The project team managed to raise $18.3 million in Bitcoin, and Ethereum’s price in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was $0.311, with over 60 million Ether sold. Taking Ethereum’s price now, this puts the return on investment (ROI) at an annualized rate of over 270%, essentially almost quadrupling your investment every year since the summer of 2014. The Ethereum Foundation officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015, under the prototype codenamed “Frontier.” Since then, there has been several network updates — “Constantinople” on Feb. 28, 2019, “Istanbul” on Dec. 8, 2019, “Muir Glacier” on Jan. 2, 2020, “Berlin” on April 14, 2021, and most recently on Aug. 5, 2021, the “London” hard fork. Ethereum’s own purported goal is to become a global platform for decentralized applications, allowing users from all over the world to write and run software that is resistant to censorship, downtime and fraud.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Who Are the Founders of Ethereum?', 'completion': ' Ethereum has a total of eight co-founders — an unusually large number for a crypto project. They first met on June 7, 2014, in Zug, Switzerland. Russian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin is perhaps the best known of the bunch. He authored the original white paper that first described Ethereum in 2013 and still works on improving the platform to this day. Prior to ETH, Buterin co-founded and wrote for the Bitcoin Magazine news website. British programmer Gavin Wood is arguably the second most important co-founder of ETH, as he coded the first technical implementation of Ethereum in the C++ programming language, proposed Ethereum’s native programming language Solidity and was the first chief technology officer of the Ethereum Foundation. Before Ethereum, Wood was a research scientist at Microsoft. Afterward, he moved on to establish the Web3 Foundation. Among the other co-founders of Ethereum are: - Anthony Di Iorio, who underwrote the project during its early stage of development. - Charles Hoskinson, who played the principal role in establishing the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation and its legal framework. - Mihai Alisie, who provided assistance in establishing the Ethereum Foundation. - Joseph Lubin, a Canadian entrepreneur, who, like Di Iorio, has helped fund Ethereum during its early days, and later founded an incubator for startups based on ETH called ConsenSys. - Amir Chetrit, who helped co-found Ethereum but stepped away from it early into the development. Ethereum had eight co-founders — but only Vitalik Buterin is still working on the second-largest crypto asset.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Who Are the Co-founders of Ethereum?', 'completion': ' At the early stage of development, Vitalik Buterin onboarded top developers and entrepreneurs to steer the formative stage of Ethereum. These individuals became co-founders of the project and contributed their quota to its success. The list includes: Mihai Alisie Alisie, due to his previous partnership with Buterin and his expertise in economic cybernetics, was a member of the founding team of Ethereum. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland. He helped set up a legal framework for the pre-sale of Ether and later emerged as the vice president of the Ethereum Foundation. In 2015, Alisie set out to start his own Ethereum-based project, named Akasha. Anthony Di lorio Anthony Di lorio was one of the financial sponsors of the Ethereum startup. He then took a back seat after the team decided to opt for a non-profit business principle. Following his decision to opt for a passive role, Di lorio emerged as the chief digital officer of the Toronto Stock Exchange for a short while before founding Decentral, the company behind Jaxx digital wallet. Amir Chetrit Amir Chetrit had a working relationship with Buterin during his stint at Colored Coins. Buterin asked Chetrit to join the founding team in December 2013. However, at a co-founder meeting in June 2014, other team members and Ethereum developers questioned the lack of input from Chetrit. It was at this meeting that Chetrit agreed to step down active involvement with Ethereum development while retaining his position as a co-founder. Charles Hoskinson Charles Hoskinson emerged as the CEO of the Ethereum startup in December 2013 only for him to hit the exit button after the team decided to promote a non-profit architecture for the organization. This spurred Hoskinson to create his version of a programmable blockchain ecosystem called Cardano. The platform is currently considered one of the major rival blockchains to Ethereum’s throne. Gavin Wood Gavin Wood was one of the core contributors during Ethereum’s early stage of development. He earned the position of co-founder as a result of his programming contributions. He created the first Ethereum testnet and even published the project’s yellow paper — the technical specification of the original white paper published by Buterin. Wood also proposed the ecosystem’s native programming language, Solidity. These days, Wood is busy working on Web3 Foundation and its flagship product, Polkadot. Jeffrey Wilcke Like Wood, Wilcke became a co-founder solely because of his programming contributions. He was working on MasterCoin when he discovered Ethereum. He began writing Google Go’s version of the platform independently. He is currently focusing on his game development studio, Grid Games. Joseph Lubin Before joining the Ethereum team, Joseph Lubin had amassed a wealth of experience in various fields. He later launched his own for-profit company, ConsenSys, which serves as an incubator for blockchain startups looking to use the Ethereum ecosystem. He has also been influential in some of the high-profile partnerships that Ethereum has secured over the years.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Makes Ethereum Unique?', 'completion': ' Ethereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform. Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically execute the actions necessary to fulfill an agreement between several parties on the internet. They were designed to reduce the need for trusted intermediates between contractors, thus reducing transaction costs while also increasing transaction reliability.

ETH works as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts. Ethereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014. The project team managed to raise $18.3 million in Bitcoin, and Ethereum’s price in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was $0.311, with over 60 million Ether sold. Taking Ethereum’s price now, this puts the return on investment (ROI) at an annualized rate of over 270%, essentially almost quadrupling your investment every year since the summer of 2014. The Ethereum Foundation officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015, under the prototype codenamed “Frontier.” Since then, there has been several network updates — “Constantinople” on Feb. 28, 2019, “Istanbul” on Dec. 8, 2019, “Muir Glacier” on Jan. 2, 2020, “Berlin” on April 14, 2021, and most recently on Aug. 5, 2021, the “London” hard fork. Ethereum’s own purported goal is to become a global platform for decentralized applications, allowing users from all over the world to write and run software that is resistant to censorship, downtime and fraud. Who Are the Founders of Ethereum? Ethereum has a total of eight co-founders — an unusually large number for a crypto project. They first met on June 7, 2014, in Zug, Switzerland. Russian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin is perhaps the best known of the bunch. He authored the original white paper that first described Ethereum in 2013 and still works on improving the platform to this day. Prior to ETH, Buterin co-founded and wrote for the Bitcoin Magazine news website. British programmer Gavin Wood is arguably the second most important co-founder of ETH, as he coded the first technical implementation of Ethereum in the C++ programming language, proposed Ethereum’s native programming language Solidity and was the first chief technology officer of the Ethereum Foundation. Before Ethereum, Wood was a research scientist at Microsoft. Afterward, he moved on to establish the Web3 Foundation. Among the other co-founders of Ethereum are: - Anthony Di Iorio, who underwrote the project during its early stage of development. - Charles Hoskinson, who played the principal role in establishing the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation and its legal framework. - Mihai Alisie, who provided assistance in establishing the Ethereum Foundation. - Joseph Lubin, a Canadian entrepreneur, who, like Di Iorio, has helped fund Ethereum during its early days, and later founded an incubator for startups based on ETH called ConsenSys. - Amir Chetrit, who helped co-found Ethereum but stepped away from it early into the development. What Makes Ethereum Unique? Ethereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform. Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically execute the actions necessary to fulfill an agreement between several parties on the internet. They were designed to reduce the need for trusted intermediates between contractors, thus reducing transaction costs while also increasing transaction reliability. Ethereum’s principal innovation was designing a platform that allowed it to execute smart contracts using the blockchain, which further reinforces the already existing benefits of smart contract technology.

Since its inception, Ethereum has maintained its spot as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. But like every other blockchain network that exists, Ethereum is not perfect. Notable, the legacy blockchain is plagued with high gas fees and low throughput of between 15 to 30 transactions per second. Although plans are already on the way to solve these shortcomings through several upgrades, many competitors have capitalized on this delay to offer crypto users cheaper and faster transactions. The term “Ethereum Killer” emerged around 2016/2017 as substitute blockchains such as Cardano began to enter the crypto scene. In 2018, EOS made its debut as the next “Ethereum killer,” raising $4.1 billion from investors, the highest amount an ICO had ever generated. Since then, others like Tezos, Solana, Fantom, Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain have surfaced as possible Ethereum killers. Each of these blockchains employs a different consensus model to tackle Ethereum’s PoW-induced limitations. For instance, Solana uses proof-of-history (PoH) while Binance Smart Chain utilizes both proof-of-authority (PoA) and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS). However, none of these alternative blockchains have been able to unseat Ethereum as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ethereum is also currently the largest blockchain for NFT trading activities.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Ethereum London Hard Fork', 'completion': ' The Ethereum network has been plagued with high transaction fees, often spiking at seasons of high demand. In May 2021, the average transaction fee of the network peaked at $71.72. In addition to the high cost of transactions, the leading altcoin also suffers from scalability issues. As already mentioned, there are plans to transition to a proof-of-stake algorithm in order to boost the platform’s scalability and add a number of new features. The development team has already begun the transition process to ETH 2.0, implementing some upgrades along the way, including the London hard fork. The London upgrade went live in August 2021. It included five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), namely EIP-3529, EIP-3198, EIP-3541, and most notably EIP-1559 and EIP-3554. EIP-1559 is arguably the most popular upgrade out of all the EIPs.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Is EIP-1559?', 'completion': ' The EIP-1559 upgrade introduces a mechanism that changes the way gas fees are estimated on the Ethereum blockchain. Before the upgrade, users had to participate in an open auction for their transactions to be picked up by a miner. This process is known as a “first-price auction,” and as expected, the highest bidder wins. With EIP-1559, this process is handled by an automated bidding system, and there is a set “base fee” for transactions to be included in the next block. This fee varies based on how congested the network is. Furthermore, users who wish to speed up their transactions can pay a “priority fee” to a miner for faster inclusion. EIP-1559 also introduces a fee-burning mechanism. A part of every transaction fee (the base fee) is burned and removed out of circulation. This is intended to lower the circulating supply of Ether and potentially increase the value of the token over time. Interestingly, less than two months after the London upgrade was implemented, the network had burned over $1 billion worth of Ether.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Ethereum 2.0', 'completion': \" In 2022, Ethereum plans to switch to proof-of-stake with its Ethereum 2.0 update. This switch has been in the Ethereum roadmap since the network's inception and would see a new consensus mechanism, as well as introduce sharding as a scaling solution. The current Ethereum chain will become the Beacon Chain and serve as a settlement layer for smart contract interactions on other chains. In late 2021, Ethereum's Arrow Glacier update was delayed to June 2022. Until then, Vitalik Buterin expects the road to the network's endgame to be shaped by optimistic rollups and Zk-rollups. In January 2022, the Ethereum Foundation announced the decision to remove the “Ethereum 2.0” terminology to “save all future users from navigating this confusing mental model.” It went on to explain that the previously-referred-to terms of “Ethereum 1.0” would be branded the “execution layer,” while “Ethereum 2.0” will be called the “consensus layer”. This is ultimately to provide a more accurate version of the Ethereum roadmap. In an update on the progress of the Merge, on April 13, 2022, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko tweeted an update on the progress of the Merge, stating that they are “definitely in the final chapter of PoW on Ethereum.” He also mentioned that users can expect it to occur a few months after June, although no exact date was provided.

The Merge implements several critical changes to Ethereum. First, it merges the existing PoW Ethereum mainnet with the Beacon Chain, a PoS chain. Together, the two chains will form the new proof-of-stake Ethereum, which will consist of a consensus layer and an execution layer. The consensus layer will synchronize the chain state across the network, while the execution layer handles transactions and block production. Second, the Merge significantly reduces ETH issuance. This has been dubbed the \"triple halving\" in a nod to the Bitcoin halving, since the Merge reduces ETH issuance by 90%. With more than 14M ETH already staked, ETH could very well become deflationary after the transition. Furthermore, stakers are expected to earn between 8% and 12% APR at current projections. Staked ETH will not be withdrawable immediately after the Merge — it will only be enabled after the Shanghai upgrade, estimated to be 6 to 12 months later. Learn more about the common misconceptions of Ethereum post-Merge. The Merge will not increase transaction throughput or reduce gas fees, as the block production rate stays roughly the same at 12 seconds (currently 13 seconds). It will also not enable on-chain governance, with protocol changes still discussed and decided off-chain through stakeholders. Importantly, the transition to PoS is expected to reduce Ethereum\\'s annual energy consumption from 112 TWh/yr to only 0.01 TWh/yr — a 99.9% drop. This reduction prompted investors to expect an influx of institutional money in a \"greener\" Ethereum.

In addition to Bitcoin’s, USDT was later updated to work on the Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, and OMG blockchains. The stated purpose of USDT is to combine the unrestricted nature of cryptocurrencies — which can be sent between users without a trusted third-party intermediary — with the stable value of the US dollar. Stablecoins are increasingly used as an inflation hedge in recent times; compared to keeping fiat currency in a savings account averaging 0.06%, users can lend their stablecoins and earn yields ranging from 3% to as high as 20%.

According to Tether, whenever it issues new USDT tokens, it allocates the same amount of USD to its reserves, thus ensuring that USDT is fully backed by cash and cash equivalents. The famously high volatility of the crypto markets means that cryptocurrencies can rise or fall by 10-20% within a single day, making them unreliable as a store of value. USDT, on the other hand, is protected from these fluctuations. This property makes USDT a safe haven for crypto investors: during periods of high volatility, they can park their portfolios in Tether without having to completely cash out into USD. In addition, USDT provides a simple way to transact a U.S. dollar equivalent between regions, countries and even continents via blockchain — without having to rely on a slow and expensive intermediary, like a bank or a financial services provider. However, over the years, there have been a number of controversies regarding the validity of Tether’s claims about their USD reserves, at times disrupting USDT’s price, which went down as low as $0.88 at one point in its history.

There have been arguments for and against the lawsuit. However, Ripple has strongly countered the claims, arguing that the SEC has been biased in its assessment. The SEC uses the “Howey test,” based on the Supreme Court ruling on SEC v. W.J. Howey Co in 1946, to determine whether a cryptocurrency is a security. An asset is considered a security if it is sold with the expectation of getting profits from the efforts of other parties.

A Paxos spokesperson told Blockworks in a statement that the company “categorically disagrees” with the SEC, adding that BUSD is not a security under the federal securities laws. The SEC Wells notice pertains only to BUSD, according to the representative, considering that there are no other allegations against Paxos. “Paxos has always prioritized the safety of its customers’ assets. BUSD issued by Paxos is always backed 1:1 with US dollar-denominated reserves, fully segregated and held in bankruptcy remote accounts,” the spokesperson said. “We will engage with the SEC staff on this issue and are prepared to vigorously litigate if necessary.” A Binance spokesperson told Blockworks the BUSD market capitalization, which was about $16 billion as of 5 pm ET Monday, is expected to decrease in the near term.

Paxos’ own stablecoin was not impacted, but the company did confirm it had been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission of potential charges in connection with its BUSD product. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency which attempts to maintain a more stable price, usually by pegging its value to an underlying asset like gold, or in this case, U.S. dollars. The move is the latest in an escalating regulatory effort to rein in the once free-wheeling crypto industry. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission settled with crypto exchange Kraken over allegations of unregistered offering and sale, in connection with Kraken’s crypto staking platform. The New York State Department of Financial Services issued the order “as a result of several unresolved issues related to Paxos’ oversight of its relationship with Binance,” the regulator said Monday in a consumer alert. “We were informed by Paxos they have been directed to cease minting new BUSD [Binance’s stablecoin] by the New York Department of Financial Services,” Zhao said on Twitter.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Is Cardano (ADA)?', 'completion': ' Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform that says its goal is to allow “changemakers, innovators and visionaries” to bring about positive global change. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Cardano. The open-source project also aims to “redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins to individuals” — helping to create a society that is more secure, transparent and fair. Cardano was founded back in 2017, and named after the 16th century Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano. The native ADA token takes its name from the 19th century mathematician Ada Lovelace, widely regarded as the world’s first computer programmer. The ADA token is designed to ensure that owners can participate in the operation of the network. Because of this, those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes to the software. The team behind the layered blockchain say that there have already been some compelling use cases for its technology, which aims to allow decentralized apps and smart contracts to be developed with modularity. In August 2021, Charles Hoskinson announced the launch of the Alonzo hard fork, causing Cardano price to surge, gaining 116% in the following month. On Sept. 12, 2021, the Cardano ‘Alonzo’ hard fork officially launched, bringing smart contract functionality to the blockchain. Over 100 smart contracts were deployed in the following 24 hours after the launch. Cardano is used by agricultural companies to track fresh produce from field to fork, while other products built on the platform allow educational credentials to be stored in a tamper-proof way, and retailers to clamp down on counterfeit goods.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Is Dogecoin?', 'completion': ' Dogecoin (DOGE) is based on the popular \"doge\" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo.

Its core component is Polygon SDK, a modular, flexible framework that supports building multiple types of applications. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Polygon Matic. Using Polygon, one can create optimistic rollup chains, ZK rollup chains, stand alone chains or any other kind of infra required by the developer. Polygon effectively transforms Ethereum into a full-fledged multi-chain system (aka Internet of Blockchains). This multi-chain system is akin to other ones such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche etc. with the advantages of Ethereum’s security, vibrant ecosystem and openness. The $MATIC token will continue to exist and will play an increasingly important role, securing the system and enabling governance. Polygon (formerly Matic Network) is a Layer 2 scaling solution backed by Binance and Coinbase. The project seeks to stimulate mass adoption of cryptocurrencies by resolving the problems of scalability on many blockchains. Polygon combines the Plasma Framework and the proof-of-stake blockchain architecture. The Plasma framework used by Polygon as proposed by the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, allows for the easy execution of scalable and autonomous smart contracts. Nothing will change for the existing ecosystem built on the Plasma-POS chain. With Polygon, new features are being built around the existing proven technology to expand the ability to cater to diverse needs from the developer ecosystem. Polygon will continue to develop the core technology so that it can scale to a larger ecosystem. Polygon boasts of up to 65,000 transactions per second on a single side chain, along with a respectable block confirmation time of less than two seconds. The framework also allows for the creation of globally available decentralized financial applications on a single foundational blockchain. The Plasma framework gives Polygon the potential of housing an unlimited number of decentralized applications on their infrastructure without experiencing the normal drawbacks common on proof-of-work blockchains. So far, Polygon has attracted more than 50 DApps to its PoS-secured Ethereum sidechain. MATIC, the native tokens of Polygon, is an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum blockchain. The tokens are used for payment services on Polygon and as a settlement currency between users who operate within the Polygon ecosystem.

The surge started after a favorable tweet by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who expressed “hope” that the Solana community “gets its fair chance to thrive” in a tweet, shortly after SOL had plunged to a record low of $8.19. Buterin’s comment headed off damage from reports that the token was the second-largest holding of Alameda Research, the trading arm of FTX whose unruly balance sheet sparked FTX’s descent into bankruptcy protection, although SOL had already declined significantly prior to the FTX revelation. According to data from DefiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) on the Solana chain dropped 96% in 2022, from $6.68 billion in January to $206 million at the end of December. SOL’s price recovery has sparked fresh hopefulness among crypto analysts and blockchain developers and executives over the blockchain’s long-term future. Critics have lambasted Solana for being too centralized and venture capital controlled. But Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, said that “with Alameda gone, the protocol is in some sense free of that baggage and can become more community-centric.” “I think Solana definitely has a lot of staying power,” Carey told CoinDesk. “Will it be a top three or five chain by [total value locked] in a year?

Polkadot was designed to provide a foundation for a decentralized internet of blockchains, also known as Web3. Polkadot is known as a layer-0 metaprotocol because it underlies and describes a format for a network of layer 1 blockchains known as parachains (parallel chains). As a metaprotocol, Polkadot is also capable of autonomously and forklessly updating its own codebase via on-chain governance according to the will of its token holder community. Polkadot provides a foundation to support a decentralized web, controlled by its users, and to simplify the creation of new applications, institutions and services. The Polkadot protocol can connect public and private chains, permissionless networks, oracles and future technologies, allowing these independent blockchains to trustlessly share information and transactions through the Polkadot Relay Chain (explained further down). Polkadot’s native DOT token serves three clear purposes: staking for operations and security, facilitating network governance, and bonding tokens to connect parachains . Polkadot has four core components: Relay Chain: Polkadot’s “heart,” helping to create consensus, interoperability and shared security across the network of different chains; Parachains: independent chains that can have their own tokens and be optimized for specific use cases; Parathreads: similar to parachains but with flexible connectivity based on an economical pay-as-you-go model; Bridges: allow parachains and parathreads to connect and communicate with external blockchains like Ethereum.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Who Are the Founders of Polkadot?', 'completion': ' Polkadot is the flagship protocol of Web3 Foundation, a Swiss Foundation with a mission to facilitate an open-source, fully functional and user-friendly decentralized web.

The team argued that the current governance system has elements of centralization. For example, the Polkadot Council, a body of executives, had sole control over some decision-making processes, including how the network\\'s treasury is spent. To this end, the new development is replacing the existing governance infrastructure with a framework in the form of a \"referendum.\" In other words, the planned upgrade will introduce a voting system allowing anyone to submit proposals and have them approved. Called Governorship version 2 or Gov2, this upgrade allegedly eliminates all forms of preferential first-class citizenry like the Technical Committee and the Polkadot Council. With this, the protocol aims to reduce the concentration of voting power by replacing the Technical Committee with the Polkadot Fellowship, designed to accommodate up to tens of thousands of members and feature a lower barrier for entry. The members are ranked to showcase the degree the protocol expects each participant to make informed decisions and support proposals that are in the best interest of the network. Another core component of the upgrade is the Origins and Tracks system. This mechanism will help grade the importance of a proposal and determine the appropriate way to treat them. As such, the network can implement suitable safeguards to ensure that the decision-making process is decentralized and fair. For instance, proposals tagged as Root Origins are the most sensitive. Such proposals undergo longer and more scrutinized consideration periods, with a higher approval threshold. Also, the system ensures that only one hypersensitive proposal can be deliberated on at a time. On the other hand, proposals with less sensitive Origins have shorter consideration periods with a lower approval threshold. Put simply, the grade of the importance of proposals will determine the type of safeguards assigned to them and the length of the decision-making process they undergo. Gov2 will first be tested on Kusama, an experimental development environment for testing applications, before it goes live on Polkadot. Once the testing and audit phase is complete, the team will submit the proposal to launch Gov2 on the Polkadot network.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Is SHIBA INU (SHIB)?', 'completion': ' Once upon a time, there was a very special dog.

Originally TRX tokens were ERC-20-based tokens deployed on Ethereum, but a year later they were moved to their own network. Initially, the project was created with the aim of providing full ownership rights to makers of digital content. The main goal is to help content creators (who receive only a small part of the income) and encourage them with more rewards for their work. How: invite content consumers to reward content makers directly (without intermediaries like YouTube, Facebook or Apple). The TRON software supports smart contracts, various kinds of blockchain systems, and decentralized applications aka dApps. The cryptocurrency platform uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin (BTC), namely UTXO. Transactions take place in a public ledger, where users can track the history of operations. Therefore, the platform was built to create a decentralized Internet and serves as a tool for developers to create dApps, acting as an alternative to Ethereum. Anyone can create dApps on the TRON network, offer content, and in return receive digital assets as compensation for their efforts. The ability to create content and share it openly without hesitation regarding transaction fees is an undeniable advantage of TRON. Network principles: The data hosted on the TRON network is free with no central authority.

The WBTC token adheres to the ERC-20 token standard, with tokens created for those who want to convert BTC into WBTC. All to-be-converted BTC is held by a custodian, who takes part in the actual minting and burning of Ethereum-based tokens. When WBTCs are burned, the user can reclaim their BTC balance from the custodian. During mining, users send BTC to the custodian for storage and receive an equivalent in WBTC tokens. BitGo is the biggest custodian for Wrapped Bitcoin, and they will mine a certain number of WBTC and send them to the merchant's Ethereum address. The user who wants to swap between wBTC and BTC performs a trade — through a centralized exchange or atomic swap on a decentralized exchange — to move funds to the merchant. Once finalized, the user can use their BTC/wBTC as they see fit. If WBTC is converted to BTC, the associated Wrapped Bitcoin balance will be destroyed through a burn transaction. The WBTC DAO consists of governing members who decide on significant upgrades and changes to the protocol.

A “Proof of Reserves” could be constructed with a Merkle tree that protects against falsification of its internal data, in this case, its total net customer balances, being liabilities of the exchange to its users.

The ‘prover’ is the party trying to prove a claim, while the ‘verifier’ is responsible for validating the claim. Zero-knowledge proofs first appeared in a 1985 paper, “The knowledge complexity of interactive proof systems” which provides a definition of zero-knowledge proofs widely used today: A zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that something is true, without revealing any information apart from the fact that this specific statement is true. Zero-knowledge proofs have improved over the years and they are now being used in several real-world applications.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Why do we need zero-knowledge proofs?', 'completion': ' Zero-knowledge proofs represented a breakthrough in applied cryptography, as they promised to improve security of information for individuals. Consider how you might prove a claim (e.g., “I am a citizen of X country”) to another party (e.g., a service provider). You’d need to provide “evidence” to back up your claim, such as a national passport or driver’s license. But there are problems with this approach, chiefly the lack of privacy. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) shared with third-party services is stored in central databases, which are vulnerable to hacks. With identity theft becoming a critical issue, there are calls for more privacy-protecting means of sharing sensitive information. Zero-knowledge proofs solve this problem by eliminating the need to reveal information to prove validity of claims. The zero-knowledge protocol uses the statement (called a ‘witness’) as input to generate a succinct proof of its validity. This proof provides strong guarantees that a statement is true without exposing the information used in creating it. Going back to our earlier example, the only evidence you need to prove your citizenship claim is a zero-knowledge proof. The verifier only has to check if certain properties of the proof hold true to be convinced that the underlying statement holds true as well.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'How do zero-knowledge proofs work?', 'completion': \" A zero-knowledge proof allows you to prove the truth of a statement without sharing the statement’s contents or revealing how you discovered the truth. To make this possible, zero-knowledge protocols rely on algorithms that take some data as input and return ‘true’ or ‘false’ as output. A zero-knowledge protocol must satisfy the following criteria: Completeness: If the input is valid, the zero-knowledge protocol always returns ‘true’. Hence, if the underlying statement is true, and the prover and verifier act honestly, the proof can be accepted. Soundness: If the input is invalid, it is theoretically impossible to fool the zero-knowledge protocol to return ‘true’. Hence, a lying prover cannot trick an honest verifier into believing an invalid statement is valid (except with a tiny margin of probability). Zero-knowledge: The verifier learns nothing about a statement beyond its validity or falsity (they have “zero knowledge” of the statement). This requirement also prevents the verifier from deriving the original input (the statement’s contents) from the proof. In basic form, a zero-knowledge proof is made up of three elements: witness, challenge, and response. Witness: With a zero-knowledge proof, the prover wants to prove knowledge of some hidden information. The secret information is the “witness” to the proof, and the prover's assumed knowledge of the witness establishes a set of questions that can only be answered by a party with knowledge of the information. Thus, the prover starts the proving process by randomly choosing a question, calculating the answer, and sending it to the verifier. Challenge: The verifier randomly picks another question from the set and asks the prover to answer it. Response: The prover accepts the question, calculates the answer, and returns it to the verifier. The prover’s response allows the verifier to check if the former really has access to the witness. To ensure the prover isn’t guessing blindly and getting the correct answers by chance, the verifier picks more questions to ask. By repeating this interaction many times, the possibility of the prover faking knowledge of the witness drops significantly until the verifier is satisfied. The above describes the structure of an ‘interactive zero-knowledge proof’. Early zero-knowledge protocols used interactive proving, where verifying the validity of a statement required back-and-forth communication between provers and verifiers.\\n\"}, {'prompt': 'What Are Smart Contracts on the Blockchain and How They Work', 'completion': ' A smart contract is a self-executing program that automates the actions required in an agreement or contract.

The foundation of DID is to give back control of identity to internet users and empower them to generate unique identifiers using the systems they trust. By enabling authentication of these identifiers with cryptographic proofs such as digital signatures, both individuals and organizations can benefit from seamless, secure and private data exchange leveraging blockchain’s distributed ledger technology (DLT). In today’s digital world, we need to provide critical information to access apps, websites, services and devices.

However, these experimental use cases of NFTs — while already a reality — may be unable to fully represent real-world assets that carry non-static information.

It connects blockchains so users on one network can participate in the activities of another. This allows crypto users to utilize their holdings outside native chains. Blockchains differ in their tokens, consensus mechanisms, communities, and governance models. A crypto bridge facilitates blockchain interoperability, allowing data and crypto asset transfers across different chains. Crypto bridges also allow blockchains to build off one another’s strengths. For example, Bitcoin doesn't have to reconstruct its blockchain to incorporate smart contracts because other networks can fill that gap. Additionally, crypto bridges allow developers to communicate and collaborate regardless of which network they're working on. As such, protocols can more easily connect and build upon one another's features and use cases. Usually, crypto bridges port tokens from one network to another by wrapping them, a process whereby the bridge locks the original token in a smart contract and creates an equivalent amount of wrapped tokens, such as WETH for ETH or WBNB for BNB. There're also other technologies focusing on interoperability in the crypto ecosystem. One such example is Layer 0 protocols.

On the other hand, DeFi lending protocols enable everyone to earn interest on supplied stable coins and cryptocurrencies.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'How Does DeFi Lending Work?', 'completion': ' The rise of DeFi has strengthened the prospects of blockchain implementation in the development of financial apps. DeFi or decentralized finance, has recently gained prominent attention as it has garnered massive amounts of capital for various businesses. You will be surprised to know that almost $20.46 billion is locked in DeFi protocols, proving that the popularity of the DeFi applications has escalated to a considerable margin. This has influenced the growth of DeFi lending. DeFi lendings are one of the upsurging parts of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. These types of loans are now allowing crypto holders to lend their assets and earn lucrative interests. In simple words, DeFi lending is all about offering crypto loans on a decentralized platform. Among all the decentralized applications (Dapps), DeFi has the highest lending growth rate globally. It is one of the prominent contributors utilized for locking crypto assets.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'How does DeFi Lending Work?', 'completion': ' By now, you know that DeFi lending aims to offer a transparent, permissionless, and open-source financial service environment. Now let’s move on to discuss the commonly asked question, “how does DeFi lending work”. DeFi lending, or decentralized finance lending, is quite similar to the traditional lending service offered by the banks, except that it is offered by the P2P decentralized applications (DApps). The DeFi lending platforms help people borrow and lend funds which allow the crypto holders to earn a substantial income. The DeFi lending process is simple. It focuses on offering crypto loans with a trustless approach. This means that the users can easily lock their crypto assets on the DeFi lending platform without worrying about intermediaries. The borrowers can directly opt for loans from the decentralized platform with the help of P2P lending. In addition to it, the DeFi lending protocol helps lenders to earn interest on crypto assets. As compared to the conventional loan processing system of the banks, DeFi lending enables individuals to become a lender just like a bank. An individual can easily lend their assets to others and accrue interest on that loan. Just like the loan offices in traditional banks, DeFi lending mainly relies on the lending pools where the users can add their assets to the lending pool and ensure quick distribution among borrowers through smart contracts.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Is Optimism (OP)?', 'completion': ' Optimism (OP) is a layer-two blockchain on top of Ethereum. Optimism benefits from the security of the Ethereum mainnet and helps scale the Ethereum ecosystem by using optimistic rollups. That means transactions are trustlessly recorded on Optimism but ultimately secured on Ethereum. Optimism is one of the biggest scaling solutions for Ethereum with over $500 million in TVL. It is home to 97 protocols, the biggest being Synthetix (SNX), a derivatives exchange, Uniswap (UNI), a DEX, and Velodrome (VELO), an AMM. Users can begin their journey on Optimism by adding the chain on their Metamask and bridging tokens like ETH to the L2. On May 31, 2022, Optimism conducted a highly anticipated airdrop of its OP token.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Is Gemini Dollar (GUSD)?', 'completion': ' The Gemini Trust Company (Gemini) is a digital currency exchange and custodian that allows you to buy, sell and store digital assets, founded in February of 2014. The GUSD is created by the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini. The company received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services or NYDFS to launch the stablecoin in September of 2018. The Gemini Trust Company holds USD deposits that correspond to the number of tokens that are in circulation. When it comes to the Gemini Dollar itself, it is an ERC-20 token that is built on the Ethereum network and has smart contracts that are audited by the security company Trail of Bits Inc. This dollar is intended to bridge the divide between traditional finance and the crypto industry, due to the fact that this specific stablecoin is completely regulated by the NYDFS.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What Is SingularityNET (AGIX)?', 'completion': ' SingularityNET is a blockchain-powered platform that allows anybody to easily \"create, share, and monetize\" AI services, thanks to its globally-accessible AI marketplace. Through the SingularityNET marketplace, users can browse, test and purchase a huge variety of AI services using the platform’s native utility token — AGIX. Moreover, the marketplace represents an outlet AI developers can use to publish and sell their AI tools, and easily track their performance. The team behind SingularityNET pioneered the development of an AI known as Sophia, which is described as the \"world\\'s most expressive robot\". SingularityNET’s goal is to enable Sophia to be able to fully understand human language, and continue developing “OpenCog” — an AI framework that is hoped to eventually achieve a state known as “advanced general intelligence,” i.e. human-level artificial intelligence (or beyond). The platform was first announced in 2017 and completed an initial coin offering (ICO) in December the same year, raising $36 million in just one minute.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'A Pragmatic View of ChatGPT in a Web3 World', 'completion': ' Language-based explorers Explorers are the search experience in Web3 and the core building block for human interactions with blockchains. However, the user experience of blockchain explorers is designed for domain experts. Imagine an explorer powered by a fine-tuned version of ChatGPT for blockchain activity. In that experience, a normal user could ask questions such as “Any large institutions transferring funds to Binance?,” “When was the last time something similar happened?” or “Are there any interesting patterns in the recent transaction activity?” Search is one of the experiences that might be reimagined with technologies like ChatGPT, and explorers could be a perfect candidate. Smart contract development assistants Programming smart contracts remains a highly sophisticated task for developers. ChatGPT components such as Codex are able to generate Solidity code from language descriptions. Imagine a smart contract assistant in which a developer can type something like “What’s the solidity code to request a flashloan in Aave?” and it will generate the corresponding smart contract code snippet. Read more: Jesus Rodriquez - The Coming Convergence of NFTs and Artificial Intelligence Smart contract security testing Smart contract audits are slow, expensive and tedious processes that are nonetheless necessary. A large majority of the auditing process relies on executing tests that are quite often not obvious to smart contract developers. Imagine having a fine-tuned version of ChatGPT for smart contract audits that could take a language input such as “” and run a battery of tests in a given smart contract. Intelligence NFTs Arguably one of the most obvious applications of models such as ChatGPT is to enable a new generation of non-fungible tokens (NFT) that incorporate conversational intelligence. Imagine a version of your favorite NFT collection that allows you to ask questions about the creator’s inspiration or specific artistic details. Conversational wallets Wallets are the main entry point for interactions with decentralized applications (dapp) in the Web3 world. Just as the user experience in Web2 applications is being reimagined with foundational models such as ChatGPT as a fundamental construct, we can think of a similar trend for crypto wallets. Imagine a wallet experience in which a user can simply express its intentions to perform a transaction, request information or execute specific tasks simply using natural language. Conversation is going to be one of the most interesting trends in Web3 user experience in the next few years.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What is Aleo?', 'completion': ' Aleo is a developer platform for building fully private, scalable and cost-effective applications.\\n'}, {'prompt': 'What is the difference between Aleo and Zcash?', 'completion': ' Zcash can only execute private transactions based on the OUTX model and have no programmability; therefore, the main difference between Aleo and Zcash is privacy programmability; and the similarity is that they both support privacy attributes (transaction privacy is not only limited to assets).\\n'}, {'prompt': 'Privacy Networks: The Future of Smart Contract Platforms', 'completion': ' Blockchains are inherently transparent. Although Bitcoin was very often associated with anonymity, the reality is that Bitcoin (and many other networks including Ethereum) are not anonymous at all. Instead, these networks are pseudonymous. Every Ethereum wallet has an address that a priori is not associated with the real name of the owner, but if Alice sends, ETH, UST, or an NFT to Bob, Bob now knows Alice’s address and can check all her assets and all her previous transactions. There’s total transparency and total loss of privacy. Currently, the largest privacy coins by market capitalization are Zcash and Monero. These coins allow private and untraceable transactions by using technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs, stealth addresses, and ring signatures.\\n'}]\n"
